## If I buy a volume, will future volumes be included in my purchase?

No. You will have to purchase each volume separately. This is a one-off purchase, not a membership or subscription.

## When will future volumes be released?

Any future volume will be released when it is finished.

## What content will be in future volumes?

We will announce the content of future volumes when they exist.

## Will this be updated for future TypeScript releases?

Maybe, but base your purchase on what you see today. There is no guarantee of future updates or promise of additional content. Purchasing this volume does not entitle access to future volumes.

## What is PPP?

Purchasing Power Parity - a lower price for users in certain countries; content is a bit cheaper and the course is only accessible from the country it is purchased from.

## Who is Total TypeScript for?

Total TypeScript is for any developer that wants to improve their TypeScript. It is for beginners, intermediates, and experts alike. Every developer has knowledge gaps - this course will improve your TypeScript, whatever your level.

## What if I've been working with and studying TypeScript for years?

Even experienced developers benefit from Total TypeScript. The course covers advanced patterns, edge cases, and deep dives into TypeScript's type system that many developers never encounter in their day-to-day work.

## Is there any live aspect to Total TypeScript or is it all self-paced?

Total TypeScript is entirely self-paced. You can complete it on your own schedule.

## What versions of TypeScript is this compatible with?

The course is designed to work with TypeScript 4.7 and above. Most content will work with any recent version of TypeScript.

## I'm having trouble getting the repo running locally. Are there any alternatives?

## None of these are my questions, can I contact someone?

Yes! You can email the Total TypeScript Support Team: [EMAIL]
