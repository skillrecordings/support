## Will I need to sign up to paid 3rd party services to complete this course?

The one service that we do use is Google Gemini, but this can be replaced by any third-party AI model that uses tool calling. You could probably run the models on your local machine, but you'd need some pretty decent hardware.

## Am I expected to talk or show my face on live sessions?

The live sessions will be primarily text-based - more like a Twitch livestream than a traditional workshop.

## Will I also learn about AI assistant tools that I can use in everyday normal non-AI TS projects?

The course assumes you are using an AI assistant to complete it. Every exercise is a prompt. I believe that building with AI is the best way to learn how to use AI in your daily life. So yes - you'll definitely get better at using AI after this course.

## What are the knowledge prerequisites for the course?

Knowledge prerequisites are pretty light. A bit of TypeScript, a bit of React.

## Can I complete the course without an AI Assistant?

Yes, you can follow the instructions manually instead of pasting them into an IDE.

However, I strongly suggest you use an AI assistant - not only for the course, but in general day-to-day development.

If you've never used one before, the course is a great introduction because you don't need to write your own prompts - you can simply get used to the AI's output.
