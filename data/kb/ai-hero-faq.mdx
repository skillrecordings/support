## Will I need to sign up to paid 3rd party services to complete this course?

The one service that we do use is Google Gemini, but this can be replaced by any third-party AI model that uses tool calling. You could probably run the models on your local machine, but you'd need some pretty decent hardware.

## Am I expected to talk or show my face on live sessions?

The live sessions will be primarily text-based - more like a Twitch livestream than a traditional workshop.

## Will I also learn about AI assistant tools that I can use in everyday normal non-AI TS projects?

The course assumes you are using an AI assistant to complete it. Every exercise is a prompt. I believe that building with AI is the best way to learn how to use AI in your daily life. So yes - you'll definitely get better at using AI after this course.

## What are the knowledge prerequisites for the course?

Knowledge prerequisites are pretty light. A bit of TypeScript, a bit of React.

## Can I complete the course without an AI Assistant?

Yes, you can follow the instructions manually instead of pasting them into an IDE.

However, I strongly suggest you use an AI assistant - not only for the course, but in general day-to-day development.

If you've never used one before, the course is a great introduction because you don't need to write your own prompts - you can simply get used to the AI's output.

## What discounts are available?

There are no hidden special discounts available.

We support purchase power parity (PPP), based on IP address of the computer you are using to make the purchase. Note that this system isn't perfect, and the discount does not always display. Keep in mind, If you use the PPP discount your purchase will be restricted to the country you purchased it from!

## Can I pay in installments/PayPal/crypto/etc.?

No, the only available options for purchase are those currently on the site.

## Does PPP limit bonus content?

PPP purchases are limited to the content displayed at time of purchase, and any current or future bonus materials/content/features may not be available. When in doubt, if you want to guarantee access to everything, purchase the product without the PPP discount.

## How do the "team" seats work? What is a "seat" in this context?

When purchasing a team seat, you will be sent a link that can be used to register the number of accounts you have bought. Licenses are non-transferrable, i.e. a license cannot be reassigned from one person to another.

## Does my company own the team license(s)?

Team licenses are actually coupon codes that can be redeemed by users. They are owned by the individual who claims the seat– not the company. Licenses cannot be transferred or "passed around".

## Can I customize the invoice with VAT or other company details?

Yes, after purchase you will find a text area that allows you to put any arbitrary information into the invoice PDF/printable.

## Can I gift a license to someone else?

Yes! The easiest way to gift a license is to enter their email address instead of your own. Note that there may be a verification code they will receive that you will have to request from them. Also, if using PPP it is important that you are both in the same country, or else your gift recipient will be unable to access the content. You are also able to purchase a team license and distribute links that way.

## Can I change my email address I used when purchasing the course?

Yes, by contacting the support team at [EMAIL]. Note that you cannot transfer your license to another person.

## None of these are my questions, can I contact someone?

Yes! You can email the AI Hero Support Team: [EMAIL]
