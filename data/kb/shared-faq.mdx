## What discounts are available?

There are no hidden special discounts available.

We support purchase power parity (PPP). This is automated based on IP address of the computer you are using to make the purchase. It's an imperfect system and the discount does not always display.

Note that if you use the PPP discount your purchase will be restricted to the country you purchased it from.

## How do the "team" seats work? What is a "seat" in this context?

When you buy a team seat, you receive a link that can be used to register for the number of accounts you have purchased. The license is non-transferable (you cannot reassign a license from one person to another).

## Does my company own the team license(s)?

Team licenses are actually coupon codes that can be redeemed by users. Companies are not meant to own or keep the licenses. They are meant to be distributed and are owned by the individual that claims that seat. They cannot be transferred or "passed around".

## Does PPP limit bonus content?

PPP purchases are limited to the content that is displayed at the time of purchase and current and future bonus materials and features might not be available. When in doubt, and if you want to guarantee access to everything, purchase the product without PPP discount.

## Can I customize the invoice? VAT/company details?

Yes, there's a textarea that allows you to put any arbitrary information into the invoice PDF/printable.

## Can I gift a license to someone else?

Yes, you can! Simply enter their email address instead of your own. There might be a verification code they receive that you'll have to request from them. Also, if you buy a PPP license, then make sure you're both in the same country otherwise they won't be able to access the content in their country.

You can also purchase a team license and then distribute the link to your team members.

## Is it possible to buy the course some other way? Installments? PayPal/etc?

No, the only available buying options are those on the site right now.

## Can I change my email address?

Yes, by contacting the support team. Note that you cannot transfer your license to another person.
