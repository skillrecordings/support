      "answer": "Hi Yatin,\nThe terminal not showing in the editor is usually a display issue. A few things to try:\n\nClear your browser cache and refresh the page\n\nCheck if the terminal panel is collapsed - look for a divider/handle at the bottom of the editor you can drag up to expand it\n\nTry incognito/private browsing mode to rule out browser extensions interfering\n\nIf none of that works, let me know which specific problem page you're on and I'll investigate further.",

      "question": "Hi Total TypeScript team 👋\n\nI’ve been using the course on your website for months now and something odd popped up a couple of days ago.\n\nFor some reason, I no longer see the console/output section under the exercises — the part where you normally see whether tests are passing or failing, logs, etc. It used to be there automatically and I didn’t change anything (at least not intentionally 😅).\n\nI’ve tried looking around for a setting or toggle to bring it back, but no luck so far. So before I blame myself entirely, I thought I’d ask: could this be a bug on your side, or am I just missing something obvious?\n\nHappy to provide more details if needed.\nThanks a lot — I’m really enjoying the course otherwise!\n\nBest,\nBarnabas\n",
      "answer": "Hi Barnabas,\nThe console panel should be visible by default in the exercise interface. A few things to try:\n\nHard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows/Linux, or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to clear any cached UI state\n\nCheck if you're using a different browser or device than usual\n\nIf you're on a smaller screen, the console might be collapsed at the bottom - look for a toggle or resize handle\n\nIf none of that works, let me know which exercise you're seeing this on and I'll investigate further.",

      "question": "Hey there,\n\nI have a potential bug report below:\n\nI don't know if something changed in StackBlitz embedding API, but it's not\nshowing errors in the code any more and I am getting errors in the console\nthat may be relevant\n\n[image: image.png]\n\n[image: image.png]\nI seem to be noticing double scroll bars as well - i think the stackblitz\nwindow was limited to viewport height before.\n\nI don't recall if the bottom bar was there before, but it shows up now,\nand...\n[image: image.png]\n\n...when I click on the \"Fork on StackBlitz\" button at the bottom, the file\nshows up properly and shows all the TS errors.\nNot a blocker since I can still work on files locally and use the \"fork on\nStackBlitz\" function, but it does make it more clunky.\n\nThanks in advance for looking into it!\n\nGreg\n",
      "answer": "Hi Greg,\nThanks for the detailed report with screenshots. This sounds like a StackBlitz embedding issue on our end. A few questions to help us track this down:\n\nWhich lesson/module in Total TypeScript Pro Essentials are you seeing this in?\n\nWhat browser and OS are you using?\n\nDid this start happening recently, or has it been like this since you started the course?\n\nOnce we have those details, we can investigate whether something changed with how we're embedding StackBlitz or if it's a StackBlitz API change on their side.",
