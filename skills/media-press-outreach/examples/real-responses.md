 Hi [NAME],​

I’m reaching out to recommend Sandy Ryza <https://kitcaster.com/sandy-ryza/>
as a guest for your podcast The Lead Engineer at Dagster Labs
<https://dagster.io/about> and a co-author of Advanced Analytics with Spark
<https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/advanced-analytics-with/[PHONE]1/>,
he’s a data leader turned engineering leader by his determination to create
the tools data professionals need with an education-first dev mindset.

Having led ML and data science teams at Cloudera <https://www.cloudera.com/>,
Remix <https://www.remix.com/>, Clover Health
<https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/>, and KeepTruckin
<https://gomotive.com/get/fleet-management/?qgad=[PHONE]&qgterm=keeptruckin&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_campaign=SEG_BRD_US_FLEET-MANAGEMENT&_bg=[PHONE]&utm_content=[PHONE]&utm_term=keeptruckin&mt=e&dev=c&dm=&nw=g&cmp=[PHONE]&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAq4KuBhA6EiwArMAw1Bi_V2oeUICQumAgyl8F1CsiwzL5ZvR4cOc6pDWqclbHtKUGfuY-SxoCRmkQAvD_BwE>,
Sandy consistently met the same roadblock wherever he worked in the
industry and made what felt like an obvious jump to dev – he knew he had to
build the tool the data industry was looking for.

Sandy decided to join the Dagster Labs team with the mission of addressing
those pain points for the data community across MLOps, data science, IOT,
analytics, and more. With him, he brought his education focused approach
engineering and leadership, never writing a line of code without first
knowing how he would train the end user.

Examples of topics that Sandy can provide value on include:

   - *Education-First Dev: Considering How to Train the End User from Day 1*
   - *Why He Pivoted From Data Science & ML to Building Dev Tools*
   - *Data as Code: Recentering the Data in Orchestration w/ Software
   Defined Assets*
   - *How the Domain of Data Orchestration is Evolving in the Context of AI
   and ML*
   - *The State & Future of Data Dev Tools*


Would you be interested in having Sandy on as a guest? I’d love to
facilitate that conversation.

Best,
[NAME]

Dear Chats with [NAME] podcast crew,

Hi [NAME],

My name is [NAME], producer for the PodRocket podcast. It's been a while
since you've joined us on the pod, and I was reaching out to see if you
might be interested in coming back on!

You’ve released some excellent videos lately on AI coding agents, what they
actually are, how they work under the hood, and why understanding context
windows and workflows really matters. I think that would make a perfect
topic for a PodRocket episode.

Let me know if you're interested or have any questions, happy to send along
more information!

Cheers,

*[NAME] Becz*

Hi there,

I represent Hello Retriever and I'd love to showcase you and totaltypescript.com in an article we are working on. In this article we discuss common data security mistakes employees make and to add maximum value, we are seeking input from experts like you who can provide insights on the topic from various diverse perspectives.

If you are willing to participate, I'll send you a question that relates to your expertise or experience. You can then provide a short response. It only needs to be 100-200 words. We will add your input to the article (we might need to edit for length), along with your name and website and a link back to totaltypescript.com. All we then ask is that you include a link to the article somewhere on totaltypescript.com, maybe on your resources page or similar so that we both benefit from the collaboration.

You can check out the article as it stands so far here: https://helloretriever.com/blog/common-data-security-mistakes-employees-make. As you can see, we have already had input from a few contributors, and I would love to include something from you to add further value to the piece.

Let me know if you'd like to participate. It would be great to feature you in the article.

Kind regards,
Lottie

Hey [NAME]. Would you be interested in speaking at PickJS (https://pickjs.com/)? It's online-only this year, so you could speak from wherever you'd like. It's a conference about advanced JavaScript topics. I'm helping organize the event this year but I know the other organizers are also interested in having you speak. 50% of the proceeds go to the WHO COVID-19 response fund. Thanks [NAME]! BTW, I was really hoping I could attend the ISYS alumni meet up a few weeks back to hear you speak, but had a meeting come up. I heard it was great!

Hi Aaron 👋


Super sorry this email slipped through the cracks for me. I'm guessing it's too late now. Either way, I'm afraid I don't have the bandwidth to sign up for anything else at the moment :-(


Hope you're doing well. Good luck!
