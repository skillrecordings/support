Hey team,

I’m tryjng again. I’m unable to access my account of Epic React. I’m not getting any Email Links. Additionally, I would like to change my Email from work to private.

Would appreciate some help with that. Can’t login and that blows. My manager paid for the whole team to have the course.

Hi David, 


I just manually requested a login link for "[EMAIL]" and it was processed and delivered successfully from our side.





Please check your inbox, spam folder or any other blockers you may have. Since the emails are being successfully delivered, it generally means that some sort of filtering is being done on your end either at the email server or in your email client.





Please let me know if you have any issues. 
```

Hey Yulissa,


I just manually requested a login link for [EMAIL] and it was processed and delivered successfully from our side.


Let me know if you don't see that one in your inbox or spam folder, or if you have any trouble requesting login links in the future.

## Example 3 (cnv_1jc7b09x)
**Question:**

I just purchased the course.
But somehow I tried twice and email is not coming to my email address.

Can you please let me know what can I do to fix this? I have attached the purchase invoice for your reference.

Looking forward to trying out new things.

**Answer:**

Hey Paras,


Sorry you're having issues getting the link. On our end It's showing delivered. Most often It's inside some email filter like your spam folder. 


If you still aren't able to find It please let us know! 


Best,

Hey Alvar, 


I see an active license under this email. I've gone ahead and sent you a magic link. Let me know if it works or not.

## Example 5 (cnv_q767h3b)
**Question:**
```
Hi EpicReact team,

We previously had access to your platform using the email address
[EMAIL] [[EMAIL]], but we are no longer receiving the login or
access emails.

Could you please check if there’s any issue on your end or let us know how to
proceed?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey Gorka,


On our end It shows we're sending the emails and they've been delivered to [EMAIL] 





This likely means they're In your spam folder or blocked by an email filter. 


Let me know if you still can't find them!


Best,
```
