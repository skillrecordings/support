## Example 1 (cnv_q5svdc7)
**Question:**
```
Hi!

I’m trying to log in and I don’t receive an email link. The page looks like it
refreshes so I’m not sure if it’s going through or not. I’ve waited a little
while and still not received anything.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey,


I've sent you a new login link and It looks like the email hard bounces. We can't do much about that on our end.


Could you use a different email address?




Best,

**Answer:**

Hey Henrique,


I did some digging and it looks like our emails are getting blocked by Spamhaus. We've made an appeal to be taken off that list. 


In the mean time the only thing we can do Is wait or transfer your email outside of a Microsoft domain.


Thanks for bringing this issue up! We appreciate that.

money is also deducted from my account. Please help here.

**Answer:**
```
Hey Snehal,


We're having trouble reaching you because are attempts so far have resulted in failed deliveries due to your email inbox being over quota.


This is likely why you haven't been able to request login links.


If this makes it to you, is there a different email address you can use? If so, we can transfer your license to it.

## Example 4 (cnv_96sgkxz)
**Question:**
```
Hi,

Just made an order for the testing javascript pro testing package. The
payment seemed to go through based on the stripe ui. But I didnt get any
email confirmation nor did clicking the get login email link work. I
understand that I am emailing this right after purchasing, but I would
assume this process would be automated.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi,


Thanks for reaching out!


It looks like the purchase failed to complete because the credit card was declined. I apologize for the confusion! We've had issues with Stripe failing without feedback and are working to correct them.


You'll need to try to purchase the course again since the original purchase didn't go through.

**Question:**
```

```

**Answer:**
```
Hello,


Apologies for the late response. 



I can help find your license! I'm not seeing any license or purchase history under the email [EMAIL]. Do you have another email I could check?


Let me know.


Best.
