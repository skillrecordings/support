Hi team ,
Greetings

I was wondering if there is a way to login without the email link ?
I would like to access the total typescript on my work laptop . I would not

Hey Akarsh,


Right now we don’t have a way to share a single license across two email addresses, sorry.


I agree it’d be a really nice feature, but we have to be careful about making license sharing too easy.


What I can do is issue an additional license for your work email, but your course progress wouldn’t sync between the two accounts.

**Customer:**
I just purchased the course.
But somehow I tried twice and email is not coming to my email address.

Can you please let me know what can I do to fix this? I have attached the purchase invoice for your reference.

Looking forward to trying out new things.

Hey Paras,


Sorry you're having issues getting the link. On our end It's showing delivered. Most often It's inside some email filter like your spam folder. 


If you still aren't able to find It please let us know!

Hi there, 


It seems like your email server and/or configurations have our emails hard bouncing, I've tried to activate your email but your server doesn't want to received the emails. Do you happen to have a gmail email we can transfer the license to?

Hi there, 


You have already access to the cohort lessons. I'll look into why you haven't been receiving the daily emails, but the content is already accessible and you can start going through the course now.

Hi,

I'm trying to login in Epic AI Pro to watch Master the Model Context Protocol course, I got it in 16/09, but I didn't receive any e-mail to login. Can you help me, please?

Atenciosamente,
Henrique Cícero


**Agent:**
Hey Henrique,


I did some digging and it looks like our emails are getting blocked by Spamhaus. We've made an appeal to be taken off that list. 


In the mean time the only thing we can do Is wait or transfer your email outside of a Microsoft domain.


Thanks for bringing this issue up! We appreciate that.

Hi Matt,

I've ordered the "Build your AI assistant in 5 days", but I didn't receive any email even after 30 minutes. I checked my spam folder as well.

I got this error message below after the payment.



Thanks,
