I am having issues to get the login link for testingjavascript for the e-mail I am writing from. There is no error, and no confirmation screen either.

Hi Epic React team,

Could you please check my account ([EMAIL]) in your system?
I'm currently not receiving the login link emails.

It’s possible I ended up on some suppression list, as my mailbox was
inaccessible for a while.

Thanks in advance for your help!
Best regards,
