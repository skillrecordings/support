# Login Link Issues

Customer bought a course but can't get the magic link to access it.

## Diagnosis Steps

1. What email are they expecting the link at?
2. Is that the email their license is under?
3. Did the link actually send (check on your end)?

## Common Causes

- License is under different email than they're checking
- Link went to spam/junk folder
- Email provider blocking our sends
- Typo in email at purchase

## Response Patterns

### If you manually resent
Confirm you did it, which email, suggest spam folder check.

### If license is under different email
Tell them which email has the license, ask them to try that one.

### If link shows delivered on your end
Confirm delivery status, suggest spam check, offer to try again.

## Phrases That Work

- "I just manually requested a login link for [email]"
- "It was processed and delivered successfully on our side"
- "Please check your spam folder"
- "I'm seeing your license under [email]"
- "Could you try requesting a login link using that email address?"

## Tone

- Acknowledge frustration without dwelling
- Be specific about what you did
- Always suggest spam folder (it's usually spam)
- Quick resolution focus

## What NOT To Do

- Don't blame their email provider
- Don't get into technical explanations of email delivery
- Don't make it sound like the problem is on their end (even if it is)

## Validation

Draft must:
- [ ] State what action was taken
- [ ] Reference the specific email address
- [ ] Suggest checking spam/junk folder
