Hey there,

Sorry you're running into errors! Let's get this sorted out.

Could you let me know:
1. Which course/workshop you're accessing?
2. What browser and operating system you're using?
3. Any specific error messages you see?

This will help us investigate and get you back on track.

Best,

## Example 2: Node Version Issue

**Question:**
```
I'm getting this error when trying to run the exercises:
TypeError [ERR_INVALID_URL_SCHEME]: The URL must be of scheme file
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

This error is typically related to Node version compatibility.

Could you check your Node version with `node -v`? We recommend Node 20 or higher for the workshops. Node 22 seems to work best.

If you're on an older version, try updating and the error should be resolved.

Let me know if you're still seeing issues after that!

Best,
```

Hey there,

Thanks for reaching out! This looks like a license verification issue on our end.

Could you try:
1. Logging out completely
2. Clearing your browser cache  
3. Logging back in

If that doesn't resolve it, please share your email address and I can check your license status directly.

Best,
```

## Example 4: Video Playback Error

**Question:**
```
Videos aren't playing - I'm getting a 403 error in the console. Also shows "upgrade to pro" even though I'm a pro user.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

Sorry you're experiencing this! The 403 error combined with the incorrect upgrade message suggests your session became disconnected from your license.

Please try:
1. Logging out completely
2. Clearing your browser cache
3. Logging back in fresh

If the issue persists, let me know your account email and I can investigate further.

Best,
```

## Example 5: Workshop Setup/CLI Issue

**Question:**
```
The ai-hero-cli keeps crashing with an error about webidl.is.File. I'm not sure what's wrong.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

This error typically occurs with older Node versions.

Could you check your Node version with `node -v`? We recommend using Node 20+ for the workshops.

Try updating Node and the CLI should work properly.

Let me know if you run into any other issues!

Best,
