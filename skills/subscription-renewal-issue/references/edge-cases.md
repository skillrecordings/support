# Edge Cases

## Example 1 (cnv_5wxqcjr)
**Question:**
```
I’m getting “Purchase to watch.” My egghead pro account expired and I haven’t renewed it. I thought this was a one‑time payment. Can you help?
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for the context — it sounds like your access is tied to an expired subscription.

Send the email you used and I’ll verify your purchase type and restore access if it was a one‑time buy.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_m5cnmrr)
**Question:**
```
I’m no longer receiving the link — neither by clicking the renew link in the old email nor by Restore purchases. I bought a course back in 2021. Is it still available?
```

**Answer:**
```
It should still be available. The renew link can expire, but we can restore access.

Share the purchase email and I’ll re‑enable your login.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_grw4347)
**Question:**
```
I am being logged out every 1–2 days. It’s annoying because I have to constantly renew my purchases.
```

**Answer:**
```
That’s not expected — your access shouldn’t require frequent renewals.

Please share your email, browser, and device so we can investigate session issues.
