## Example 1 (cnv_mu04pfr)

Hi there! My account is set to expire in a few days and I want to renew it. I can’t see whether my card is saved for auto‑renew. Can you check if any action is required?
```

**Answer:**

Happy to check. I can confirm whether auto‑renew is enabled or if a manual renewal is needed.

Please share the email on the account, and I’ll take a look.

Great question. For this product, it’s a one‑time purchase (not a subscription).

If you share which course you bought, I can confirm the exact access terms.
