**Question:**
```
I cannot log into your website. Please stop my subscription.

## Example 2 (cnv_da6mwqv)
**Question:**
```
I’d like to confirm that once an Epic React Pro license is purchased, there's no need to renew. Is that correct?
```

**Answer:**
```
Yes — that license is a one‑time purchase with ongoing access.

If you want, I can verify the purchase on your account.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jdcf59h)
**Question:**
```
I purchased access a while back, but it looks like I no longer have access. Does the subscription have an expiration date?
```

**Answer:**
```
Let’s check the account to confirm your access type.

Share the email you used and I’ll restore access if it was a one‑time purchase.
```
