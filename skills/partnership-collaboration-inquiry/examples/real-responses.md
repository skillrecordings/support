Hey Matt Pocock team,

Really enjoyed your recent videos. Your breakdown of AI tools and how to
use them best is always spot on.

I'm reaching out from Composio <https://composio.dev/> about a partnership
opportunity around the Cowork launch.

As you know, Cowork is trending. We recently shipped *Open **Claude CoWork
(*https://github.com/ComposioHQ/open-claude-cowork*)*, an open-source take
on Claude Code. Most existing implementations (including others in OSS) are
essentially GUI or browser-based wrappers that automate tasks locally or
rely on browser automation for SaaS apps — which gets slow and brittle.

What makes Co-Work different is that it comes *natively integrated with
800+ APIs* as composio manages the auth on backend. This means users can
not only automate desktop tasks, but actually complete real knowledge work
across tools like Linear, Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc. fast.

We’d love to collaborate on a dedicated video where you walk through
Co-Work and, in the process, explore why deep, API-level integrations
matter for agentic workflows.

The project’s getting strong organic traction already — Julian Goldie and
Tom Doerr have both shared it recently — and momentum is picking up
quickly. I have attached some example demos of its capabilities. Do you
think this will be a fit for your audience?

Would love to do a dedicated video this week.
Best,
Audery Graham
Composio <https://composio.dev/>

I'm unable to route this directly to Matt through the system. Since this is a business partnership inquiry rather than a product support question, it should be forwarded to Matt's business development contact directly. You'll want to reach out to the appropriate business contact channel for Total TypeScript rather than through support.

Hello there,

Reaching out to you for a possible collaboration with Notta.

My name is Huzaifa, and I represent *Awaisson Media*, an influencer marketing
agency working with tech and lifestyle brands. We’re currently
collaborating with *Notta* to promote their newly launched *Notta Memo*, a
smart voice recorder designed for students, creators and businesses.

We’ll be running multiple YouTube campaigns over the next two months and
would love to explore working with you. The product will be *gifted* for
review and we’re seeking creators for *dedicated videos* or *video
integrations*. I can share the past campaigns we've worked on with creators.

To move forward, could you kindly share your rates for integrations? Please
also share your channel's audience demographics.

Unlike many agencies, we ensure smooth and timely processes. Once the
contract is signed, the product is shipped right away.

Looking forward to your reply!

Best regards,
--

Hey Matt,

I'm reaching out to check if you would be interested in showcasing Motia in
one of your videos.

We're building React for the Backend. Motia unifies APIs, background jobs,
queueing, streaming, states, workflows, AI agents, observability, scaling,
and deployment into a single coherent system with shared observability and
developer experience. Similar to how React simplified frontend development,
where everything is a component, Motia simplifies backend development,
where everything is a Step.

Let me know what you think, And we can discuss further.

Hey  Kent C. Dodds  ,


I’m Cherry from Partnerly（ https://partnerly.us/）
 — we help top AI & tech brands grow through awesome creator
partnerships. Think of us like your plug-in for long-term collabs with
exciting AI software launches.


Some of our regular partners?

HubSpot, Airtable, Genspark, Nebius, ScaleAI, and 80+ more across the
US, EU, and Asia.


We’d love to kick off a long-term partnership with you, starting with
a dedicated thread for
“Genspark”→  https://www.genspark.ai/
  (an AI productivity tool that’s been blowing up lately).


We also launch
4+ fresh AI products every month**, so plenty of follow-up collab
opportunities if it’s a good fit.


If this sounds interesting, could you drop me your rates for a dedicated thread?


Would be great to get something rolling!


Cheers,

Cherry
