# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
Is there a private or partner API we can access?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not offer a separate partner API at the moment. The public API docs at [LINK] cover what is available.

If you have a specific integration need, tell me more and I can pass it along.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
The docs seem outdated. Is there a newer version?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for flagging that. Can you share the page or section that looks outdated? I will forward it to the team.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
Do you have an SDK instead of raw API calls?
```

**Agent:**
```
If an SDK is available, it will be listed in the docs at [LINK].

If you tell me your language and use case, I can check.
```
