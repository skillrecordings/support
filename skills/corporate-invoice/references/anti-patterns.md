# Anti-Patterns for Corporate Invoice

## Anti-Pattern: Missing Required Fields

❌ **BAD:**
"Here's your invoice!" (sends basic receipt)

✅ **GOOD:**
"Here's your invoice with company name, address, and VAT/tax ID as requested. Let me know if your finance team needs any fields adjusted."

**Why it's wrong:** Corporate invoices need specific info for reimbursement/accounting.

## Anti-Pattern: Not Offering Bulk Options

❌ **BAD:**
"I've sent the invoice for your individual purchase."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Invoice attached! By the way, if your company is interested in team licenses (5+ seats), we offer volume pricing - let me know if you'd like details."

**Why it's wrong:** Corporate requests often indicate team interest. Opportunity to upsell appropriately.

## Anti-Pattern: Long Wait Times

❌ **BAD:**
"I'll generate this invoice and send it within 2-3 business days."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Invoice attached! Let me know if you need any changes for your reimbursement."

**Why it's wrong:** Invoices should be immediate. Finance deadlines are often tight.
