I would like to purchase the Standard Testing course, however I need an invoice with my employer’s details on it so that they will reimburse me the costs.

Is this something you guys can do pre-purchase or do I need to purchase the course first and then you can provide an invoice with the below details?

Business Name: TSED Unipessoal, LDA

Thanks in advance,

Hello! I’m planning on using my company’s personal development fund on buying
this course. I need to clarify some of the questions before I can proceed the
purchase.

I need to get an invoice after buying this course. What do I have to do to
receive one? I can see that payment is being processed by stripe, but I can’t
see any input field to put in my company’s number. (We operate from the European
Union).

Please let me know ASAP, as I need to start working on this course quickly!
Thank you!
