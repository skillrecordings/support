**Question:**
```
Hi Epic React team,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m very interested in purchasing access to the Epic React v2 course to
continue improving my skills as a frontend engineer. I plan to expense this
as professional training through my employer, but in order to do that, my
company requires a pro forma invoice before they can process the payment.

Since the course price is a significant amount of money for me to pay
upfront personally, I would really appreciate it if the payment could be
made directly by my company based on a pro forma invoice, instead of me
advancing the full amount and getting reimbursed later.

Could you please issue a pro forma invoice including:

   - My name and email associated with the Epic React account (Adrian
   Pereira, [EMAIL])
   - Billing details for my company
      - Company name: Empathy Systems Corporation SLU
      - CIF/ VAT number: ESB83601377
      - Company address: C/Jimena Fernández de la Vega, 101. 33394. Gijón,
      Asturias.
   - Total annual amount, currency, and payment method/details

If there is a specific process or platform I should use to provide billing
details or request this document, please let me know and I will follow it.

Thank you very much for your help and for the work you do with Epic React.

Best regards,
Adrian

Hey Adrian,


We only make custom invoices for larger team purchases.


For individual purchases you'll have to purchase the course here https://www.epicreact.dev/buy and you'll receive an invoice after purchase that you can use to be reimbursed.

Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Best,
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1jboirol)
**Question:**
```
Hey

I just purchased the course with the above email address ([EMAIL] <mailto:[EMAIL]>).

Is it possible to get a receipt rather than an invoice? I managed to convince my company to pay so this would be really appreciated. 

If it is possible to put the following email on the receipt that would also be really appreciated and make my life much easier: [EMAIL] <mailto:[EMAIL]>

I was a bit nervous about switching the account to my work email as I wasn’t sure I’d be able to switch it back again?

Thanks a lot and all the best
Dave

Hey Dave,


Our receipts don't have the emails on them. I've attached It. If you need the email I can give you an updated invoice with [EMAIL] on It!


Let me know.

Hi all,

Hope you’re doing well.



I’m  Luis and I work at TSED - Unipessoal Lda.. We are a tech company based
in Portugal (within Flutter Entertainment group).



To finish one purchase process related to the attached invoice, and the ID (
*5d58b6b9-7e1f-44be-aafe-**7a50d49f7ca3)* we need to ask you to send us the
following information:

1. Provide the RFI (RFI_21_TSED attached) form simply signed by your
company, and

2. A certificate of residence for this tax year (2025) – a document issued
by your local tax authorities certifying your company address for tax
purposes and the liability to income tax in your country.



In order to give you some context, in Portugal, all services provided by a
company non-resident are subject to a Portuguese withholding tax of 25%,
since the income is considered as obtained in Portugal.

However, according to the Double Taxation Agreements, we can avoid this
withholding tax (25% of income/invoice) if you send us those documents.

As we want to be your customer and to simplify future purchases at your
company in 2025, we would like to get these documents as soon as possible.



Many thanks in advance for your help.

Please, feel free to ask me if you have any questions.



Best regards,

Luís Lopes

Hey Luís,


We don't fill forms for foreign taxes sorry. I've attached a document with our tax information.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I would like to enroll in the Epic React V2 training through my company. In
order to proceed, my company requires you to fill out a purchase order,
which I will provide, to complete the payment.

Would this be possible?

Thank you in advance for your response.

Dear reader,

As part of my company’s (ABN AMRO) learning policy, I am potentially eligible to partake in TotalTypeScript, provided that certain requirements are met. With respect to invoicing, the requirements are as follows:
      

  *
Invoicing in the name of the ABN AMRO and not the student themselves.
  *
Invoicing is possible from the start or delivery date.
  *
A payment term of 30 days after receipt of a correct invoice.
  *
All costs on one invoice, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
  *
Invoicing according to the legal invoice requirements (see www.belastingdienst.nl).

I would love to hear whether these requirements can be met.

Kind regards,

Arjen

Hey Arjen,


That's correct. It's In our policy for individual purchases to get an invoice post purchase. Sorry If that doesn't work out.


Best,
