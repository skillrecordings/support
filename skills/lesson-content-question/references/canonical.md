## Example 1 (cnv_1jb59dk5)
**Question:**
```
In video 22, you build on saving the post from the previous video. But the
previous video ends after testing that the button is disabled. The repo has
assertions for saving the post that I never saw in the videos. Is a video
missing or was something skipped?
```

**Answer:**
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1jbzkwit)
**Question:**
```
All links to the OpenAI docs on the course page go to a generic prompt
engineering page instead of the specific sections. Did the docs move?
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi,

Thanks for reaching out! It looks like the docs were restructured and the links
need updating. I've added the correct targets and will make sure the page is
updated.

please let us know.

## Example 3 (cnv_4uryksn)
**Question:**
```
I downloaded the v2 printables zip, but the contents look like the v1 course.
Can you check?
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi,

Thanks for reaching out! That does sound like the wrong bundle. I've refreshed
the download on our side so the v2 materials are included.

Your questions and insights can help others too. If the issue persists after a
fresh download, please let us know.
