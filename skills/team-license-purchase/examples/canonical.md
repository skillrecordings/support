Hi team,

I'm looking to arrange about 30+ licences for the Pro package. Do you offer
any volume based discounts on top of what your website calculator suggests?

Thank you!

Regards,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


Thank you for your interest in the course!


The volume-based discounts we offer are automatically applied when you purchase through the website, so the amount you see calculated is the price with the discounts already included. I've copied our bulk discount levels below:


- 5% off 5+
- 10% off 10+
- 15% off 30+
- 25% off 50+
- 35% off 80+
- 45% off 100+


Let me know if you have any questions!
