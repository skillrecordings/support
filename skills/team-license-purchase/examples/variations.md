**Question**

Hey Total TS! I'm a tech lead and “TypeScript caretaker” at Kaluza. We make
software used by energy retailers like OVO in the UK and are expanding into
Australia, Japan and beyond. We use TS heavily on the front and back end. I'm
interested in team pricing for our org. I've put down 20 seats but we're around
100 engineers so I'm keen to understand the process for adding people, whether
that has to happen up front or if it's possible to add more over time etc. Many
thanks! Tom

Let me know If you have anymore questions!
