Good afternoon,

I am reaching out from Hickam AFB looking to purchase several Epic React Pro Team licenses for TRON, our local software development team. I have several questions when you have the time.

Hi there!

I am looking to purchase the KCD bundle, and some standalone javascript
testing courses, for a number of people on my team.

It doesn't appear that I can do it easily online. Art least from what I can
see anyway!

Can someone please help me out with this?

I am looking to do 9 KCD Bundles and 5 standalone testing.

Many thanks,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


Thanks for reaching out!


Currently, the KCD bundles need to be purchased individually. You can buy them using the same credit card, but you'll need to enter the email address of the person the bundle is for during checkout.


We do offer team pricing for Testing JavaScript Pro - you can select it by clicking the "team discounts" button in the Testing JavaScript Pro column. That will allow you to purchase five licenses at once, with bulk discounts automatically applied depending on how many licenses you purchase.

Hi!

I've pinged Matt on Twitter and he instructed me to ask via email about
buying a few seats for our frontend devs here at Microblink.

We're currently looking to get 4 licences, but expect at least 5 more after
new year's once our education budget gets refreshed.

Is there a minimum number of seats required to qualify for bulk discounts?
Also, does the bulk discount stack with regional pricing?

All the best,

There are no regional discounts for team purchases but they will accumulate over time as you add seats. Meaning if you buy 4 today and 6 next month it will apply bulk discounts for 10 seats to the purchase of the 6 if that makes sense 😅
