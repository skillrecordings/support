Hi team,

I'm looking to arrange about 30+ licences for the Pro package. Do you offer
any volume based discounts on top of what your website calculator suggests?

Thank you!

Regards,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


Thank you for your interest in the course!


The volume-based discounts we offer are automatically applied when you purchase through the website, so the amount you see calculated is the price with the discounts already included. I've copied our bulk discount levels below:


- 5% off 5+
- 10% off 10+
- 15% off 30+
- 25% off 50+
- 35% off 80+
- 45% off 100+


Let me know if you have any questions!

Hello,
I run a team of about 30 Engineers. Several developers on my team have
purchased your training and they absolutely love it. We want to buy it for
everyone.

Would it be possible to get an invoice from you and get you a purchase
order?

I don't have a way of using a company credit card to buy all of the
licenses on the website.

Thanks!

Hey [NAME],


No problem!


The total cost for 38 Epic React Pro licenses is $19,347.70 (38 x $599 with a 15% bulk purchase discount applied).


I sent the invoice over - let me know if you have any questions or need anything else! I'll send you the licenses when we receive payment.

Hi!

I've pinged Matt on Twitter and he instructed me to ask via email about
buying a few seats for our frontend devs here at Microblink.

We're currently looking to get 4 licences, but expect at least 5 more after
new year's once our education budget gets refreshed.

Is there a minimum number of seats required to qualify for bulk discounts?
Also, does the bulk discount stack with regional pricing?

All the best,

There are no regional discounts for team purchases but they will accumulate over time as you add seats. Meaning if you buy 4 today and 6 next month it will apply bulk discounts for 10 seats to the purchase of the 6 if that makes sense 😅

Hi there!

I am looking to purchase the KCD bundle, and some standalone javascript
testing courses, for a number of people on my team.

It doesn't appear that I can do it easily online. Art least from what I can
see anyway!

Can someone please help me out with this?

I am looking to do 9 KCD Bundles and 5 standalone testing.

Many thanks,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


Thanks for reaching out!


Currently, the KCD bundles need to be purchased individually. You can buy them using the same credit card, but you'll need to enter the email address of the person the bundle is for during checkout.


We do offer team pricing for Testing JavaScript Pro - you can select it by clicking the "team discounts" button in the Testing JavaScript Pro column. That will allow you to purchase five licenses at once, with bulk discounts automatically applied depending on how many licenses you purchase.

Hey Total TS! I'm a tech lead and “TypeScript caretaker” at Kaluza. We make
software used by energy retailers like OVO in the UK and are expanding into
Australia, Japan and beyond. We use TS heavily on the front and back end. I'm
interested in team pricing for our org. I've put down 20 seats but we're around
100 engineers so I'm keen to understand the process for adding people, whether
that has to happen up front or if it's possible to add more over time etc. Many
thanks! [NAME]
```

**Answer**

Hi [NAME],


For 20 seats you get 25% off so It will be $7,500. I've attached the quote. 


We have an option on the site that lets you add more seats as needed. It will look like this:

Hey, I am a Dev manager here at GoDaddy and I was looking to see if you have any
bulk or team discounts for your course?

Can you send me some detail on that if you have any? It would help me decide how
many employees to enroll for the course.

Thanks,

[NAME]

We do, it's at various levels and you can use the widget here to see them, though the current 40% off promotion is going to cover most scenarios under 50 seats or so.

If you have more devs than that we can put together a quote.
