# Anti-Patterns for Team Licenses

## Anti-Pattern: Standard Pricing Only

❌ **BAD:**
"Each license is $499, so 10 licenses would be $4,990."

✅ **GOOD:**
"For 10 seats, we can do $399/seat ($3,990 total) - that's 20% off. Includes centralized admin, usage reporting, and priority support. Want me to set that up?"

**Why it's wrong:** Team purchases always get volume pricing. Lead with the deal.

## Anti-Pattern: No Admin Features Mentioned

❌ **BAD:**
"I've set up 10 licenses for your team."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Done! You'll get a team admin dashboard to manage licenses, see progress, and add/remove seats. Here's your admin login: [link]"

**Why it's wrong:** Team buyers need management features. Highlight them.

## Anti-Pattern: Slow Enterprise Process

❌ **BAD:**
"For team purchases, please contact our sales team and we'll schedule a call to discuss your needs."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Happy to set this up now! For 10 seats at $399 each: here's an invoice link. Or if you need a formal quote/PO process, I can do that too - just let me know."

**Why it's wrong:** Many "enterprise" buyers just want to buy. Don't add friction.
