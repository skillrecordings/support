# Anti-Patterns for Pricing Inquiry

## Anti-Pattern: Just Linking to Pricing Page

❌ **BAD:**
"You can find all our pricing at https://..."

✅ **GOOD:**
"The complete course is $XXX, which includes lifetime access and all future updates. We also have PPP pricing if you're outside the US, and team rates for 5+ people."

**Why it's wrong:** They can find the page themselves. Add value with context.

## Anti-Pattern: Not Mentioning Discounts

❌ **BAD:**
"The course is $499."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Full price is $499. We have regional pricing (PPP) available, plus occasional sales. Want me to check if any discounts apply to you?"

**Why it's wrong:** Always surface available discounts proactively.

## Anti-Pattern: No Value Justification

❌ **BAD:**
"Yes, that's the price."

✅ **GOOD:**
"At $XXX you get lifetime access, all updates, community Discord, and [specific features]. It's designed to be a one-time investment that pays off quickly."

**Why it's wrong:** Pricing questions often mask value concerns. Address both.
