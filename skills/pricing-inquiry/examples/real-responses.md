Hello,

I am a Epic React V1 Pro user. Is the upgrade to v2 included in my original
purchase or do I need to purchase v2 separately?

Thanks,
-John Riviello
```

**Answer**

```text
Hi John,


If you own Epic React V1 you can get an upgrade discount! It's an entirely new learning experience and was a ton of work. You can find more details here: https://www.epicreact.dev/ 


Let me know If you have anymore questions. 


Best,
```

Hi!

I am interested in buying the Total TypeScript Core volume course, but without the React course included. I had seen this option a couple weeks ago but now when I look into the website the only option available includes the Advanced React with TypeScript.

Is there a way to buy just the Core Volume as it used to be?

I even have taken a screenshot of the option last time I’ve seen it there. This is the one I am interested in:





Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,
Thales

We only have the single bundle available currently.

It’s too pricey.  Even discounted, it’s US$400.  My price point for
something this specific is max $199 but truthfully it’s an instant buy at
$99.

It looks like excellent content and I do not suggest you change anything
about your pricing. Just giving you one person’s thought process on this
and I hope it helps.  Good luck!

Instead of something cheaper, what would make this course worth $400+ to you?

The price is incredibly logical, actually.

## cnv_hs1mgjr

Hi Matt,

To be honest, the price...
I love your content and your post and I think I should acquire your
course... but it's really not cheap.
I am not doubting the value of the content.

I transitioned from a python backend/data dev to a frontend dev and between
your book and refactoringui <https://www.refactoringui.com>, the choice was
easy.
I had more garanty (the feeling at least) to get the best ROI on their book
with less risk of being disappointed.
UI is hard for me, typescript is also hard but I feel like at the end of
the day, I will find my answer on Google (also because I have done Rust,
C++, and other strongly typed languages).

I still need to improve at typescript and I would recommend to a company to
buy your resources for teaching juniors and seniors. But for my budget,
it's too much.

Hope this helps, and I am sorry for not being able to support your work.
Have a nice day.

Matt's lessons are definitely the best I've seen for typescript, however

Hey Damir,


Thanks for reaching out!


This price isn't always available - The KCD bundle price is discounted right now for the Black Friday sale and the price will go back up once the sale ends.


Please let me know if you have any further questions!

**Question**

Hi Matt,

First of all thank you for all the great content you put out. I’ve learned
a bunch from you already, and I’m grateful for that.

That’s also why I felt compelled to reply to your email. I was looking
forward seeing your course, but seeing the current price it’s way to
expensive for me. I can imagine it will save me a lot of time, but since
it’s not an essential skill, and in combination with that most topics can
also be learnt for free, it’s just too much.

This can obviously just be my take on it. And I really hope you get all the
revenue from the course you’ve set out to get. But I can also imagine it
scares people away when there’s such a high price tag.

Personally, if the course would cost max 200 euros, I would take it. It’s
still a lot of money but it feels fair for online content.

I hope it helps and wish you all the best!

Greetings,

Kerim

No worries, the price was intentional to support development and production costs as well as to invite more engaged participants.


The self-paced version that will follow will have a smaller admission price, but might still be above your personal cost threshold.


We are working on free stuff here -> https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials

Didnt see this in the FAQ. I assume if I purchase the course that this is a "lifetime" subscription and I would get access to all updates to the course over time. Is that correct?

Thanks!

Yes - The course is yours to keep forever and it will be kept up to date.
