**Question**

Hi,

I’m interested in the Total TypeScript course and had a quick question
before purchasing.

If I purchase the *TypeScript Pro Essentials* bundle now, would I be able
to upgrade to *TypeScript Pro Complete* later at a discounted price (e.g.,
by paying only the difference)?

I just want to confirm the upgrade path before making a decision.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
Natthakit

Quick q about the pricing- if I grab the Essentials ($250), can I buy other
workshops later or are they only available in the Complete package?
```

**Answer**

```text
Hello,


If you buy essentials without the regional discount you're have the option to upgrade to the full complete package crediting what you've already paid into the price. You won't be able to get individual workshops.


Let me know If you have anymore question.

Hi,

I'm looking into buying the TypeScript course but have trouble understanding if it's a purchase or a subscription. Is the cost yearly or do I have access to the course indefinitely?

Hello,

I am a Epic React V1 Pro user. Is the upgrade to v2 included in my original
purchase or do I need to purchase v2 separately?

Thanks,

Hi John,


If you own Epic React V1 you can get an upgrade discount! It's an entirely new learning experience and was a ton of work. You can find more details here: https://www.epicreact.dev/ 


Let me know If you have anymore questions.
