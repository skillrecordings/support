I want to purchase the Epic React course, but I’m confused what currency the purchase is in? I live in Canada so I’m wondering if it will charge my credit card in CAD or USD?

Thanks,

Hey Sean,


Thanks for your interest in the course!


All prices are listed in USD. We use Stripe to process payments, and they automatically calculate and apply any currency conversion that is required.

Hi,

I'd love to take your Epic React course. Now I need to write a plan for my
manager so that my company can sponsor me with the course. I'm wondering
whether the fee is Canadian dollar or US dollar.

Thanks,

Hi,

Didnt see this in the FAQ. I assume if I purchase the course that this is a "lifetime" subscription and I would get access to all updates to the course over time. Is that correct?

Thanks!
