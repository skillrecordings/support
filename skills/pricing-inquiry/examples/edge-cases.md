I already own the core volume and was looking at adding the React bundle.
However, when I look at the available options the prices seem a little off. The
Core Volume + React Bundle is showing I would owe $240 and just purchasing the
Advanced React with TypeScript course would be $200. Is there something I am
missing that is causing the $40 difference?
```

Can you check now and see if the upgrade price makes sense? It should be $160 to upgrade.

Hi!

I am interested in buying the Total TypeScript Core volume course, but without the React course included. I had seen this option a couple weeks ago but now when I look into the website the only option available includes the Advanced React with TypeScript.

Is there a way to buy just the Core Volume as it used to be?

I even have taken a screenshot of the option last time I’ve seen it there. This is the one I am interested in:





Thanks in advance!

Kind regards,
Thales

Hello,

What do these courses offer compared to ones for free on YouTube or 10x cheaper on Udemy etc?

Thanks,

**Answer**

```text
The workshops have a 30-day money-back offer, so the risk is nominal. If you prefer to spend your time sifting through Youtube and Udemy to save money, we won't be offended!

I am reaching out about the new "Build Your Own AI Personal Assistant in TypeScript" course. I previously purchased the AI SDK V5 Crash Course, but the discount does not seem to be applying.

Can you please assist me on this.

Thank You,

Hello!
I wanted to know if I buy the Pro Essentials course and I like it, after
completing it, would there be any discount if I decide to purchase the Pro
Complete course? Thank you!. I am from Argentina.
```

**Answer**

```text
Hello,


You will have the option to upgrade to the Pro Complete course crediting what you've paid for Pro Essentials. If you purchase Pro Essentials with a regional discount you will only be able to upgrade to a Pro Complete full license and no discounted PPP would be applied. 


Let me know If you have anymore questions. 


Best,
```
