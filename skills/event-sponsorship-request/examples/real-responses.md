Hi again,
As usual I'm trying my luck and maybe this year our community will finally
get to meet you (You have a huge fan base here :). )

ReactNext <http://www.react-next.com> 22 is happening in-person on June
28th 2022 in Tel Aviv with 1000 expected attendees, and we will be thrilled
if you will be our keynote speaker this year.

We will ofcourse cover your flight + 3 nights at a hotel, and invite you to
join our Speaker Tour to the Dead Sea and Jerusalem. We will also cover any
PCR test you may need for traveling.
We are also holding our Node.js conference <http://www.nodetlv.com> on June
29th if you would like to attend that as well and we will cover an extra
night for that:)

Let me know if you are interested in speaking at our conference this year
(fingers crossed), looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

[NAME]! Thank you for the great 'state of MCP' summary.
We're running an MCP-focused event for 200+ engineering leaders in Seattle
on Oct. 29. How do we talk you into joining us? We loved your Dev Days talk
about Jarvis, and your post about MCP Search ... our audience would too.
This is a community event; not a corporate event.
Are you available on Oct. 29?

Dear EpicReact.dev Team,

Our organization, Tech Horizons Club, is excited to host our debut virtual
hackathon, Hack the Vibe, on Devpost from June 13–15, 2025. We anticipate
over 350 participants from the tech and student communities, all focused on
building AI-powered MVPs using our "vibe coding" concept – essentially,
using natural language prompting for rapid product development.

Given EpicReact.dev's expertise in training and empowering developers with
cutting-edge React knowledge, we believe your support would be incredibly
valuable to our participants. Your resources could provide them with the
foundational and advanced skills needed to build robust front-end
experiences for their AI-powered projects.

We are seeking support in one of two ways:
 * Monetary sponsorship: To help with our prize pool and platform logistics.
 * EpicReact.dev platform access/resources: EpicReact.dev could provide
resources or workshops on best practices in React development, or offer
credits or access to specific course modules for participants to utilize
during their hackathon projects.

In return, we'd be thrilled to feature EpicReact.dev prominently across our
Devpost page, during workshop sessions, and on our social media channels.
This would position your brand in front of a dedicated audience of
developers and future tech leaders.

Would you be open to connecting to discuss this further? We'd be happy to
share our detailed sponsorship kit.

Thanks,

[NAME] Club Team

Hi [NAME]

My name is [NAME] and I am the organizer of Uphill Conf. I wanted to ask you if you would like to come and speak at our conference on 24th April 2020. 
 
Uphill Conf is a single day conference and takes place in Bern, Switzerland. We are a rather small conference with 1 talk track and a more casual “lounge track”.  In addition, we are going to organize full day workshops the day before the conference. 

We will cover all your expenses for flights, train tickets and accommodation to and in Switzerland. Like every year we are going to organize a full day speaker event the day before the workshops. 
 
More information about the conference can be found on our webpage : https://uphillconf.com/
 
If you are interested in coming to Switzerland I can send you more detailed information about the conference.
  
Best regards,
 
[NAME]

Hello,

We are considering running a contest at one of the events where our company will
be participating, and we would like to give away a license to your product to
some of the winners. At this stage, I cannot specify the exact number of
licenses needed, but I wanted to ask whether there is a way to purchase licenses
for this type of use case.

Thank you for your help.

Hey [NAME],


I can create an invoice for you, and once it’s paid I’ll provide 100% off coupon codes for you to distribute.


How many licenses would you like to purchase?


Best,

My name is Iris, and I am trying to reach Matt Pocock on behalf of kode24
[https://www.kode24.no/] and «kode24-dagen» (code24-day in English), Norway's
Coziest Developer Conference. After the tremendous success of our past events,
with over 300 passionate developers in attendance, we are thrilled to extend an
invitation for you to be a keynote speaker at our upcoming conference on 5th of
March 2024 at The Hub in Oslo, Norway.

 

kode24-dagen is renowned for bringing together the most engaging and amiable
professionals in the industry. Our event, filled with inspiring talks,
interactive experiences, and a vibrant exhibitor area featuring prominent
sponsors like Bouvet, Capgemini, and Telenor, focuses heavily on full-stack
development with a strong emphasis on web technologies.

We believe that your expertise would greatly contribute to the success of our
conference. As a keynote speaker, you would have the opportunity to share
insights, experiences, and future trends in the ever-evolving field of web
development. We envision your keynote inspiring our attendees, guiding them on
what skills to acquire in 2024 and offering valuable perspectives on effective
work methodologies.

 

One unique aspect of kode24-dagen is the opportunity to experience the warmth
and innovation of the Norwegian tech community. If you haven't had the pleasure
of visiting Norway, we would be delighted to show you around Oslo, our vibrant
capital city. From its picturesque fjords to its modern architecture, Oslo
provides a unique backdrop for networking and cultural exploration.

 

If you are available and interested in being a part of kode24-dagen, we would be
honored to host you. Please let us know your availability and any specific
requirements you may have.

Thank you for considering our invitation, and we look forward to the possibility
of having you as a keynote speaker at kode24-dagen.

Hi [NAME],

Hope you're doing great. I was wondering whether you would like to come give a talk at the conference (May 14-15) and if possible a workshop on the 12th (9:30am-5:30pm) about React testing. We will also take care of travel and lodging and if you come with your spouse we'll take care of hers too plus a $4000 stipend for the workshop (we'll take care of venue, food, wifi, ticket promotion, etc).

Let me know what you think.

Best,

-[NAME]
