Hello,

I signed up for the MCP fundamentals workshop scheduled on June 17th back
in May and I can't seem to find the calendar invite to the event. Is there
any way I can get another calendar invite for that sent to this email? I've
attached the invoice for the event in case that helps.

Looking forward to the workshop!
Josh

   Hi Josh,

You should have received a calendar invite. I've pinged the team to have them look into why you haven't received it. Below are the details from the calendar event:

 
Hello! Please read this all ASAP!
Watch this ASAP: https://www.epicweb.dev/tips/preparing-for-a-workshop-with-kent-c-dodds
I'm so stoked that you're coming to join me for this series of workshops. All the official workshop information will be communicated via this calendar event. Please RSVP that you are attending to get it onto your calendar and keep an eye out for updates to the event description which will include the latest information you need to know.
The more prepared you are for the workshops, the more you will get out of your time and money, so please put forth your best effort to make this experience the best it can be for you.
What you need to know about workshops with Kent:
1. I'm constantly working on improving the workshop material, so you may need to setup the workshop on your machine at the start of the event.
2. You are responsible for reporting any setup issues to the workshop GitHub repo at least 24 hours before the event. I can't promise that I'll be able to fix any issues that are reported less than that.
3. We use gather.town for audio/video and screen sharing. You need to create an account using the same email you used to sign up for the workshop. Spend some time in there familiarizing yourself with the interface (and customize your avatar).
4. We use discord for text chat during the event. This allows us to keep a history of our chat in one place you can reference later. All our chats will happen in a thread in this channel.
5. Each workshop will have a list of system requirements and pre-requisites. Please review these asap and if you need to review some of the resources listed in the pre-requisites, please do!
What you need to know about this workshop:
1. The GitHub repository is at github.com/epicweb-dev/mcp-fundamentals
2. The Discord thread is at https://discord.com/channels/715220730605731931/1374135602106208286
What you should do right now:
1. Review: Check the system requirements and pre-requisites. I'll say that again, review the pre-requisites.
2. Test workshop setup: Follow the setup instructions and report any issues on the GitHub repo.
3. Join Discord: If you have not already, you will need to join the KCD Community on Discord by creating an account on kentcdodds.com and clicking "connect discord" on your profile page. Join the discord thread above by introducing yourself.
4. Join Gather.town: Sign up for a free account and create your own test space by clicking the "Get Started" button at the top. It should only take a few minutes and it'll allow you to get familiar with the tool. The space will be locked down so make sure you use the same email address for your Gather.town account as the one receiving this calendar event! gather.town
5. Join the KCD space on Gather.town: I'll try to hang out in there as much as I can to say hi and invite you to explore the amazingly cool space I've prepared for us. Let me know if you have trouble getting in. The URL is kcd.im/gather
Again, please keep an eye on your inbox for updates to this event description. I'll communicate more to you in the future! If you ever need anything, feel free to email [EMAIL]!
— Kent

Sorry for the trouble!


– Kent

Hello,

Can I get an invite to this event? I can't seem to find a spot to register myself. I think I had assumed I didn't need to invite myself with the group invoice since I had the account that paid for the seats.

Thanks,
Josh

 Hi,
I purchased a ticket for Kent's workshop "Be where your users are with MCPs"  on May 8.  Would it be possible to change it for the same workshop on May 15?
I am a cancer patient at UCSF and I have a blood transfusion scheduled on May 8 at the same time.
Please let me know.
Thank you,

Hey Adrianna,
That's great! I just added you to the Google Calendar event, and am including the information here (which you will get emailed about again soon)

There are a few things you need to know in advance so we can make the most of the time we have together for the Advanced React with TypeScript workshop on Friday, June 16th at 9AM Pacific.


We use Zoom, so be sure to have it installed.


We will get started right away, so having the workshop repository installed and set up ahead of time is required. No time will be available for troubleshooting setup issues when the workshop begins.


Here’s the link to the repo:


https://github.com/total-typescript/react-typescript-tutorial


We will be working through sections 4 through 8 for the workshop. 


Be sure to pull changes over the next couple of days leading up to the workshop, as there may be some updates! It may also be helpful to work through the React with TypeScript tutorial ahead of time: https://www.totaltypescript.com/tutorials/react-with-typescript

> I'm really looking forward to tomorrow! Please please please, make sure to reserve an hour to go through all of the instructions at https://www.epicai.pro/events/workshop-advanced-mcp-features-2025-07-30 before tomorrow starts. It's critical to your success and learning. Otherwise you will spend the first 20 minutes or more missing instruction trying to figure out how things work and in general have a bad time.
> But we don't want to have a bad time! We're going to have an epic time! So check out and follow the instructions and we'll have an epic time tomorrow. And because this is an advanced workshop, please make sure you check out the resources on the README of the repo as well. See you soon!
