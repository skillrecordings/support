Hi Team,

Would really love to purchase this. Wanted to ask do you or do you ever
plan to officer a pay over 3-6 month option? That would allow me to
purchase this.

Thanks,
Daniyaal

I’m interested in enrolling in the “Build Your Own AI Personal Assistant in TypeScript” course.
Could you please let me know if there is a flexible payment plan available, ideally something spread over 6–12 months?

Hello, I am very interested in the Epic React course, I saw the price is 1 time
for full access, is it possible to do the payment in instalments I cannot afford
it at once, I would really like if I can get access to it sooner rather than
waiting a couple more of months to be able to purchase it. Thank you

Hey,


We don't offer payments In installments. You'll find all of our checkout options here: https://www.epicreact.dev/buy

Hi Kent,

Is there a way to pay the Epic React Pro in installments? $417 in one shot is a
bit heavy on me. Let me know thanks!
```

**Answer**

```text
During the checkout Stripe displays various options including pay over time options, but it's when available and we don't have control over it outside of turning it on.
```

## cnv_jsogm4n

**Question**

```text
Matt,

By chance, do you support any payment types such as PayPal that allow payment
over time?

Your course looks awesome and as somebody learning the AWS CDK, a TypeScript
video based deep dive course is exactly what I’ve been looking for.

With the current economic situation, a one off payment is not something I can do
sadly.

If not, I’ll come back once in a position to do so as your YouTube videos are
great so can only imagine what your full course will be like!

All the best,

Andy

We've got some "pay over time" options enabled in the checkout, but they are presented based on availability from Stripe.
