# Canonical Examples

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
Do you offer an installment plan for this course?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for asking. We do not currently offer a built-in installment plan.

If a pay-over-time option is available for your region, it will appear at checkout. Let me know which product you are interested in and I can confirm.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
Can I pay monthly instead of paying in full?
```

**Agent:**
```
At the moment we do not support monthly payments directly.

If you share the course and your location, I can check whether any payment options are available at checkout.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
Is there a payment plan for the Pro package?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not have a dedicated payment plan. If an installment option is available, it will show up at checkout for your region.

If it does not, you can also start with a smaller package and upgrade later by paying the difference.
```
