# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
My company will reimburse me, but I need a split invoice across months. Can you do that?
```

**Agent:**
```
We cannot split invoices across months. We can provide a standard receipt or invoice for a single purchase.

If you need billing details, share them and I can help.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
Can you reserve my spot if I pay a deposit now and the rest later?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not support deposits or partial payments.

If you need help choosing a smaller option to start, let me know.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
I tried to use a pay-over-time option at checkout but it was not available.
```

**Agent:**
```
Those options are provided by the payment processor and can vary by region.

If you share your location and the product you tried to buy, I can confirm what should be available.
```
