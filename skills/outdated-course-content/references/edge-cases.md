## Example 1
**Customer:**

I bought this last week and it already feels outdated. Can I get a refund?

I am sorry to hear that. If you want to proceed with a refund, I can help with that.

Please confirm the email you purchased with and I will take care of it.

Is there an updated version coming? I need this for work soon.

Thanks for checking. I do not have a confirmed date to share, but if you tell me the exact lesson and your timeline, I can see what we can do.

This lesson uses an old library version. Do you have a patch or notes?

Please send the lesson name and the version you are using. I can look for updated notes or point you to a newer resource.
