Hi 👋 , 

I noticed the transcript for the `Validate All Files are Properly Formatted with Prettier` video under the `Static Analysis Testing JavaScript Applications` chapter is not correct (in tandem with what the video is saying) towards the end.

The package.json file in the video specifies that the `npm run validate` script should be `npm run check-format && npm run lint && nom run build` but the last screenshot on shows `npm run lint && nom run build`

Thanks for curating such a wonderful material.

Hi

I Came across this course Learn to Publish an Open Source JS Library |
Frontend Masters <https://frontendmasters.com/courses/open-source/>.
It's outdated, I wanted to know if there is newer course on same subject.

Or if you could recommend other related resource.

Thanks

Hi [NAME],


At Egghead we offer the same course for free, and It was more recently updated 3 years ago​ How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library. Still gonna be a bit old, but lots of good info. [NAME] also has some great blogs on his site about open source kentcdodds.com.

Feel free to ask the same questions on Kents discord! I'm sure you could get some great recommendations there https://kcd.im/discord. 

I hope this helps! 

Best,

Hi [NAME],

Hope this email finds you well!

I just bought the Pro testing course for your portal and realized that the
code is updated.
I wanted to check with you if the material is still relevant.

Please let me know if there is anything I need to do to get the latest
content.

Thanks & [NAME],

It's very relevant. There might be some specific syntax that requires adjustment, but there's no better javascript testing course on the internet.

Now that Supabase has removed triggers from their documentation as of
 08/24/2021 (I coudn't find any information related to the code that's been showed
 on the video as they have a bunch of broken links in their docs). Is this
 still something recommended to do?
Thanks!

```

**Answer**

```text
Hello,


Documentation on creating public user tables has been moved here. The creator of Supabase has mentioned that they removed the triggers because they caused some problems for devs getting started with SQL, but triggers are still a great way to do it.

Hi [NAME],
   Looks like the lesson below from now onwards needs to use @emotion/jest
instead of
   jest-emotion. I was getting the error shown in the screenshot.
Test an Emotion Styled UI with Custom Jest Snapshot Serializers[image:
Screenshot 2021-02-05 at 10.54.49 PM.png]
<https://testingjavascript.com/lessons/jest-test-an-emotion-styled-ui-with-custom-jest-snapshot-serializers>

jest.config.js becomes

// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  snapshotSerializers: [
    '@emotion/jest/serializer' /* if needed other snapshotSerializers
should go here */
  ]
}

There is a code snippet typo in the section, "Write React Application
Integration Tests with React Testing Library" (
https://testingjavascript.com/lessons/react-write-react-application-integration-tests-with-react-testing-library
).

At 2:21, the variable "testDAta" should be "testData".

Hello,
juste a quick question, as the web and the best practices grows so fast, is
the content of the formation still up to date ? I think most of the
contents are valuable, as it deals with the core of the subject, but are
there some untreated topics, or are you planning to make an update about
some ?
Thank you for your time.

We are working on a fully updated version that you will have access to for free if you buy the current version (that is still excellent and valid)
