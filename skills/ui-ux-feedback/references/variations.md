## Example 1 (cnv_4ypxiyv)
**Question:**
```
I can log in and see a sign out button, but I only see a “Preview Course” button and no way to access the units.
```

**Answer:**

Thanks for the screenshot description — that’s a confusing UX state.

Please send the account email so I can verify access and make sure the full navigation appears.

**Question:**
```
I bought the course and watched a couple videos, but now I don’t see any video window or play button.
```

That shouldn’t happen. I’ll help get the player back.

Please share the course URL and your browser/device details.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_3us1q6f)
**Question:**
```
I’d like to purchase the course, but the page won’t load the prices — the buy buttons keep reloading.
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for reporting this — we’ll investigate the pricing page behavior.

Please share the page URL, your browser, and your country/region so we can reproduce it.
