# Canonical Examples

## Example 1 (cnv_1jbxyu91)
**Question:**
```
I purchased the course. I have access only to the MCP UI but nothing more. On the main page there is no place to start from. I was expecting a big button. There is “enroll now” which is misleading after buying.
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for the clear feedback — that’s a confusing experience.

We’ll update the page to show a clear “Start Learning” entry point for paid users. I’ll also help you get to the right starting lesson right now.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_5r206mf)
**Question:**
```
I’ve been experiencing a lot of bugs with the platform: the progress bar stays at 0, skip buttons don’t work, and videos won’t resume after pausing.
```

**Answer:**
```
Sorry you’re hitting those — that’s frustrating.

Please share your browser/device and the course name so we can reproduce and fix it. I’ll also pass this to the product team.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_5wty1tz)
**Question:**
```
Once you watch a video it changes the play button to a check mark. Is there a way to reset it back to the play button so I can track a second pass?
```

**Answer:**
```
Great suggestion. We don’t currently have a reset feature, but I’ll log this as a UX improvement.

In the meantime, I can suggest a workaround if helpful (like tracking progress in a playlist or notes).
```
