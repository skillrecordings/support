# Edge Cases

## Example 1 (cnv_543y1vr)
**Question:**
```
The player freezes when I jump to a specific time. The “+25s” button also freezes it. Also, the keyboard opens every time I go to the next video.
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for the detailed report — that’s very helpful.

Please share your device/browser version and the lesson URL so we can reproduce and fix those player UX issues.

## Example 2 (cnv_8gnzklj)
**Question:**
```
I think the button that links to each workshop’s git repo on the home page has been removed. It would be nice to bring it back.
```

**Answer:**
```
Good call — that repo button is useful. I’ll pass this along and see about restoring it.

If you have any other UI improvements in mind, I’m happy to forward them.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_8j60vbb)
**Question:**
```
After purchase I saw a big “Download your Certificate” button but it disappeared after refresh. Was I supposed to see that?
```

**Answer:**
```
That button should only appear after completion, so it sounds like a UI glitch.

I’ll flag it for the team and make sure the button appears at the right time for your account.
