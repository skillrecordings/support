If you'd like to fully customize your exercise environment we recommend cloning the repository and working in your local IDE of choice.

## cnv_iq7qo3r

**Question**

```text
This entire form validation page was very difficult to get through. There are
way too many small videos and they all end abruptly; Once the video ends, it
cannot even be rewound, which is frustrating. It would probably flow more
smoothly with fewer, longer videos; and it is also much easier to
rewind/forward/pause through long videos.

Also there was some confusing information like the abbr attribute, which I think
only exists for <th> elements, not <label>. (Perhaps you were thinking of the
<abbr> tag?) But why mention it if it is not supported anyway? Similar deal for
the email pattern.
```

**Answer**

```text
Thanks so much for the feedback. I will keep this in mind going forward!


You are also correct about the abbr element vs. attribute. It's not very helpful to be in there as written. So I appreciate you pointing it out!

:neutral_face: So far so good, one suggestion is to allow bookmarks at
 specific points in the videos

**Question**

```text
Hi [NAME],

My Feedback:

On the workshops page at /workshops, put a call to action button so that it will
be easy for people to buy the workshops instantly.

Now it’s a four-step process:
1. View
2. Start Learning
3. Completing one problem and its solution, and then the next problem displays
Unlock this exercise now
4. Become a TypeScript Wizard

Those above four steps will still exit, but this time we can duplicate “Become a
TypeScript Wizard” and place on the /workshops page (somewhere appropriate).

Thank you for your amazing TypeScript resources.
```

**Answer**

```text
Thanks, it's still a pre-release so we haven't optimized for conversion yet.

## cnv_fkz32br

**Question**

```text
Could you please add a search feature to search for videos across the
course using one or more keywords?

For instance, I wanted to go over the error-boundary video which I went through months back and I wasn't sure which section has that topic, so I had to manually open each section like "React Hooks" and click on each sub-section like "useState" "useEffect" and found that under "useEffect: Http Requests". It would have saved a lot of my time if there was an option to search for video with title containing "error" or "error boundary"
```

**Answer**

```text
Hello,


Thanks for the feedback, we will definitely consider that.

## cnv_m1ef24n

**Question**

```text
IDK if you have any control over it, but I would love a larger font size in the
editor.

Loving the content so far. Really great work.
```

**Answer**

```text
Hi, 


We don't have control over that. It's not perfect for sure. We recommend using VS Code or similar locally if the inline editor is aggravating.
```

## cnv_lqwk347

**Question**

```text
It would be amazing to have a way to mark lessons as completed (or have it
automatically set when I successfully pass all the tests). Getting a “completion
badge” or similar for completing each section as well as the course overall
would be great for me to highlight my credentials (resume, linkedin) and get you
some additional promotion (linkedin, twitter, etc.) wherever I share the
credentials.
```

**Answer**

```text
Hi there, 


Each lesson will be marked as complete and once you complete each workshop you will receive a certificate which you can share on your social media.
```
