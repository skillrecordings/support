**Customer:**
```
It's expensive.

Hey there,

Thanks for the feedback! We understand that pricing can be a significant consideration.

We do offer regional pricing (PPP) that provides discounts based on your location. If you haven't already, you should see adjusted pricing when you visit the purchase page.

We also run periodic sales - the newsletter is the best way to stay informed about those.

Is there anything specific about pricing I can help clarify?

Best,
```

## Example 2 (cnv_hrz8bwn)

**Customer:**
```
Hi Matt, Still with the regional pricing, it's a good amount of money in my country because of the exchange rate fluctuations. I'll try to make it before the deal ends.
```

**Agent:**

Hey there,

Thanks for sharing that feedback! We understand that even with regional pricing, exchange rate fluctuations can make courses challenging to afford.

Good luck with making the decision! If you have any questions in the meantime, feel free to reach out.

```

## Example 3 (cnv_hrzb98n)

**Customer:**
```
Hi Matt, Love to see the course and I've heard great things about you as a typescript instructor. However, I'm a high school student and I don't have enough money to purchase the course even at the reduced rate. Is it possible to get a student discount?
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Pelle,

Thanks for the kind words about the course! I appreciate your interest in learning TypeScript.

I've flagged your request for review. Someone from our team will follow up with you about options for students.

Best,
```

## Example 4 (cnv_hrzbfd3)

**Customer:**
```
Hello, At the moment as a freelancer based in South Africa, I am not yet able to afford the course. Hopefully once I get a few more clients I will be able to afford it in the near future.
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey there,

Thanks for sharing! We understand that as a freelancer, timing investments in learning can depend on business flow.

We do run sales periodically - signing up for the newsletter is the best way to catch those. Regional pricing should also apply automatically when you're ready.

Best of luck with the client work!

Best,
```

## Example 5 (cnv_hrzbjd3)

**Customer:**
```
Hi Matt, I'd really like to take your course but the price point is just too high for me, I'd be buying it myself not through a company.
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey David,

Thanks for the feedback! We understand that individual learners have different budget constraints than company-sponsored purchases.

A few options that might help:
- Regional pricing (PPP) applies automatically based on location
- We run periodic sales - newsletter is the best way to hear about those
- Some learners find it easier to expense through their employer's learning budget

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
```

## Example 6 (cnv_hrzcb0n)

**Customer:**
```
lol Your courses are great. The free tutorials were well designed. I'm currently working at a place where they are using react and haven't wanted to adopt TS. Me prior it was my next milestone step. I've done a ton of research and tutorials. I think paying when I just can read the docs and have really good understanding coupled with working on a team...
```

**Agent:**

Hey Angel,

Thanks for the thoughtful feedback! You make a fair point - if you're already comfortable with the fundamentals and have good resources, the value proposition shifts.

The courses are really designed for those who want structured, deep-dive learning or need to level up quickly. Sounds like you have a solid foundation already.

Best of luck with your learning journey!

Best,
```

## Example 7 (cnv_hrzcsav)

**Customer:**
```
I bought it but under a different email!
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Adam,

Great to hear! Thanks for letting us know - we can help link accounts if needed.

What email did you purchase under? I can make sure everything is properly connected.

Best,
```

## Example 8 (cnv_hrzdafb)

**Customer:**
```
Hi Matt, I'm currently in process of seeing if my employer will pay for it. At the moment I'm an apprentice on a lowish salary so the price tag for training is quite high compared to my salary. I might even make this a condition of employment once I move on from my apprentice title!
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Oli,

Thanks for sharing! Getting employer sponsorship is a great approach - many companies have learning budgets specifically for this.

Good luck with the request! If your employer needs an invoice or has questions about team licensing, let us know.

Best,
```

## Example 9 (cnv_hrzdbwn)

Too expensive

**Agent:**

Hey William,

Thanks for the feedback! We understand pricing is a consideration.

Regional pricing (PPP) applies automatically based on location, and we run periodic sales. The newsletter is the best way to stay informed about those.

```

## Example 10 (cnv_hrzenk7)

**Customer:**
```
Hi, I think it's great what you are doing but it's just a bit too expensive since my company does not pay for it.
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Jannik,

Thanks for the kind words and feedback! We understand that out-of-pocket purchases hit differently than company-sponsored ones.

Some options to consider:
- Regional pricing applies automatically
- Periodic sales are announced via newsletter
- If you'd like help making a case to your employer, we can provide materials

Best,
```

## Example 11 (cnv_hrzep6v)

**Customer:**
```
Hi Matt, I'm really interested in the course for my whole JS Team (~3 person) but the pricing is currently too steep regarding our company's current finances.
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Yann,

Thanks for reaching out! For teams, we do offer team licensing which can provide better value than individual purchases.

Would you like me to send over information about team pricing options? We might be able to work something out that fits your budget.

Best,
```

## Example 12 (cnv_hrzfg5j)

**Customer:**
```
Well, I follow your tips on twitter since long time, and also started beginner module of Total Typescript. Will start the next module via github. I cannot afford the core volume as I'm still a student in 3rd year engineering even after PPP as I'm from India. Would love to know if you can giveaway the course for students?
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Shekhar,

Thanks for following along and working through the modules! That's great dedication.

I've flagged your request for review - someone from our team will follow up with you about student options.

## Example 13 (cnv_hrzfnev)

**Customer:**
```
Hello Matt, The thing that is holding me back is the price. It is very expensive, even with the Romanian discount ($220).
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Bogdan,

Thanks for the feedback! We understand that even with regional pricing, $220 is still a significant investment.

We do run periodic sales that can provide additional discounts. The newsletter is the best way to stay informed about those.

Best,
```

## Example 14 (cnv_hrzgdc7)

**Customer:**
```
I'm part of many of these kinds of deals. Lets Get Rusty, Papa React - both have content updates and split over 3 payments. I would have preferred the content be constantly updated and payment split over 3 payments. This is my 2 cents!
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Ian,

Thanks for the thoughtful feedback and the comparison to other programs! Really appreciate you sharing what payment structures work for you.

I'll pass this feedback about payment plans and content updates to the team - it's valuable insight for how we might structure things.

Best,
```

## Example 15 (cnv_hrzhvgn)

**Customer:**
```
Hey Matt, It's the time of year; I can't afford your course after spending so much for Christmas. Also, time... I wish I had more time to dedicate to your course.
```

**Agent:**
```
Hey Stephen,

Thanks for sharing! Totally understand - the holidays can be tough on both budget and time.

The courses are self-paced and your access doesn't expire, so whenever you're ready works. And we do run sales throughout the year.

Hope you have a great holiday season!

Best,
```
