## Example 1: Simple "Too Expensive" Feedback

**Question:**
```
It's expensive.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

Thanks for the feedback! We understand that pricing can be a significant consideration.

We do offer regional pricing (PPP) that provides discounts based on your location. If you haven't already, you should see adjusted pricing when you visit the purchase page.

We also run periodic sales - the newsletter is the best way to stay informed about those.

Is there anything specific about pricing I can help clarify?

Best,
```

## Example 2: Individual Purchaser (No Company Sponsorship)

**Question:**
```
I'd really like to take your course but the price point is just too high for me. I'd be buying it myself, not through a company.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

Thanks for the feedback! We understand that individual learners have different budget constraints than company-sponsored purchases.

A few options that might help:
- Regional pricing (PPP) applies automatically based on location
- We run periodic sales - newsletter is the best way to hear about those
- Some learners find it helpful to check if their employer has a learning budget

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
```

## Example 3: Freelancer/Budget Timing

**Question:**
```
As a freelancer based in South Africa, I am not yet able to afford the course. Hopefully once I get a few more clients I will be able to afford it in the near future.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

Thanks for sharing! We understand that as a freelancer, timing investments in learning can depend on business flow.

We do run sales periodically - signing up for the newsletter is the best way to catch those. Regional pricing should also apply automatically when you're ready.

Best of luck with the client work!

Best,
```

## Example 4: Team/Company Budget Constraints

**Question:**
```
I'm really interested in the course for my whole team (~3 people) but the pricing is currently too steep for our company's current finances.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

Thanks for reaching out! For teams, we do offer team licensing which can provide better value than individual purchases.

Would you like me to send over information about team pricing options? We might be able to work something out that fits your budget.

Best,
```

## Example 5: Regional Pricing Still Too High

**Question:**
```
The thing that is holding me back is the price. It is very expensive, even with the Romanian discount ($220).
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey there,

Thanks for the feedback! We understand that even with regional pricing, it can still be a significant investment.

We do run periodic sales that can provide additional discounts. The newsletter is the best way to stay informed about those.

Best,
