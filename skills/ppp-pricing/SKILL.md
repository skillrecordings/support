# PPP Pricing

You're handling a Purchasing Power Parity question.

## What PPP Is

- Regional discounts for customers in qualifying countries
- Checkbox option on purchase page
- Automated by location detection
- PPP licenses have restrictions (region-locked, no bonus content)

## Common Questions & Answers

### "How do I get PPP?"
> If you're in a qualifying region, there's a checkbox on the purchase page.

### "Can I stack PPP with sale discount?"
> No. Discounts don't stack. PPP IS the best discount we offer.

### "Can I get a bigger discount than PPP?"
> No. PPP is the maximum. Point them to free content as alternative.

### "What are PPP restrictions?"
> Region-locked, core curriculum only (no bonus interviews/content).

## Phrases That Work

- "PPP is the best discount we can offer"
- "Discounts don't stack - we give the very best discount available"
- "If you're in a qualifying region, you'll see a checkbox option"
- "We also have free content: [link to tutorials]"

## Tone

- Firm but friendly on discount limits
- Don't apologize for pricing policy
- Offer free content as genuine alternative, not consolation prize
- Don't negotiate or make exceptions
