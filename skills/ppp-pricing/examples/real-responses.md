I see the full price is *$795*, the current discount brings it to about
*$397*, and the PPP price fo

**Agent:**
Hey [NAME],


Thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately, we aren't offering any more discount scholarships at this time.


If you live in a qualifying country we offer a PPP and its automated so whatever discount it displays is what's available in your location.

**Customer:**
Hello,

I’ve purchased the “Epic React Pro”, and it says “Regional License”, and I have
a button to upgrade to full license, what does this mean?

I live in Brazil.

Do I already have access to all content?


**Agent:**
Hey,


Looks like you got a license with the PPP checkbox option enabled. 



In the disclaimer we mention the regional PPP license Is region locked, and doesn't have bonus content only the core curriculum.


You have access to all the content besides bonus interviews.


Let me know If you have anymore questions!
