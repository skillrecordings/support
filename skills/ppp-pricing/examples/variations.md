# Variation Examples

## Example 1 (cnv_1jcc7jad)
**Question:**
```
Hi Total TypeScript team,

I wanted to double-check if the location-based discount of 60% is currently correctly applied.

The current discount of 50% from 795 on TypeScript Pro Complete is 397.50.

With Bulgaria discount to activate 60% off with regional pricing, the discount is applied on the total price = 318, not on the current discount price = 159.

Is that correct? I want to make sure everything is ok before deciding to purchase.

Thank you for the great work.

**Answer:**
```
Hey Zahari,


The highest discount would be your PPP discount. The sale discount ended, but also It didn't stack with PPP. 


Let me know If you have anymore questions.


Best,
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1jblvkmd)
**Question:**
```
Hello. I'm writing this from a country where I can apply for PPP. The 50% discount doesn't apply for us. I mean the price still the same when there is no discount. Is that bug ?
```

**Answer:**
```
This is correct. Discounts don't stack and we give the very best discount available.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_8rr26kn)
**Question:**
```
Hi,

Is the Epic React course any cheaper in India?

Wes
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey Wes,


I've just verified the discount is displaying correctly when using a VPN with India as the location:





If you don't see it when browsing, the issue is due to location - either your physical location or your browser reporting a location that isn't included in our parity pricing regions. Sometimes the location information is obscured by VPN settings or browser plug-ins.
```

## Example 4 (cnv_1jbn5gf9)
**Question:**
```
Hello Matt,

My name is Abdelaziz, a developer from Morocco. I’m a big fan of your work, I
watch your videos on YouTube regularly, and I truly appreciate the effort and
dedication you put into teaching. I’ve learned so much from you, and your
content has been a real inspiration for me.

I’m very interested in purchasing the TypeScript Pro Complete bundle. However,
even with the 65% regional discount applied, the price comes to $278, which is
about half my monthly salary. Unfortunately, this is beyond what I can afford at
the moment.

I’m writing to kindly ask if it would be possible to receive an additional
discount, ideally around 94%, so I could purchase it for $50, which is the
maximum I can manage. I completely understand if this isn’t possible, but I
thought it was worth asking as I’m very eager to learn and apply your teachings.

Thank you so much for your time and for the incredible content you create. I
hope to continue learning from you and one day support your work fully.

Warm regards,
Abdelaziz

Hey Abdelaziz,


Sorry to say, but we're not able to increase the discount. The highest regional discount Is the highest we offer right now.

## Example 5 (cnv_1jcazew5)
**Question:**
```
Dear team,
I got recently laidoff from my organisation. So I have absolutely no money
to pay even with purchase parity. If u are able to offer this course for
free for 6 months, it'll be great. Thanks. And ofcourse once I learn from
here, I'd be happy to repay my debt by freelancing for your website (for a
while)


*Thanks & RegardsRaksha A*
