## Example 1 (cnv_oc6e51j)

for PPP?

Cheers

The PPP discount does not stack.

## Example 2 (cnv_cz34fif)
**Question:**
```
Hi!

I am from the Philippines and I was wondering if the bundle discount will
stack with the PPP discount? Thanks!
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi,


Thanks for reaching out!


We don't stack discounts, so you'll need to use either the bundle discount or purchase the individual courses using the parity pricing discounts for each.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_pyr9kuf)
**Question:**
```
Hello,
I am from Kenya, is it true that PPP is limited to resources and course
content?
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey,


You'll have access to everything but the pro interviews and future discounts don't stack with PPP. 
```

## Example 4 (cnv_1jbphbvp)
**Question:**
```
Hello,

I’ve purchased the “Epic React Pro”, and it says “Regional License”, and I have
a button to upgrade to full license, what does this mean?

I live in Brazil.

Do I already have access to all content?
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey,


Looks like you got a license with the PPP checkbox option enabled. 



In the disclaimer we mention the regional PPP license Is region locked, and doesn't have bonus content only the core curriculum.


You have access to all the content besides bonus interviews.


Let me know If you have anymore questions!


Best,
```

## Example 5 (cnv_1jbxd6xx)
**Question:**
```
Dear [NAME],

Hi [NAME], I come from Viet Nam. I plan to buy a Just Javascript Course and I plan only visit from Viet Nam but do not see PPP offer and support generate a custom receipt. Can I request it from here?

Thank you for your attention!

Best regards,
[NAME] Nguyen
```

**Answer:**
```
Hey [NAME],


We don't offer a PPP for Just Javascript. After purchasing the course we send a receipt.


Best wishes,
