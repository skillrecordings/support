Hey Epic React team!

I'm not sure if it's intentional or not, but it seems like the "Render as
You Fetch" videos don't match the exercise in the react-suspense repo
<https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-suspense/blob/main/src/exercise/02.md>.

They're both about the same concept, but the code is different. The
exercise in the repo is using some Pokemon stuff as the example, but the
videos are using some bookstore application. So the solutions in the videos
don't apply to the exercise.

Cheers,
[NAME]

You are correct! We'll get that fixed up. Thank you for reporting!

Hello!
I started the Epic React course online, and am running into an error when trying to start React Fundamentals. It says, “There was an error loading content.” I’ve attached a screenshot of the error, along with what the browser console is saying. This happened in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox There was a point when I tried it in Firefox where it prompted me to log in, so I thought perhaps that had something to do with it, but after logging in the same error occurred.

Any help you can give me is greatly appreciated! Thank you!

Hello!
I tried going through one of the free courses, unfortunately the page crashes
with a Nextjs client-side exception whenever I click on any “excercise” page.

Error: [sandpack-client]: "entry" was not specified - provide either a
package.json with the "main" field or an "entry" value
```
