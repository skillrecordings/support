# Anti-Patterns for Technical Issues

## Anti-Pattern: Generic Troubleshooting First

❌ **BAD:**
"Please try clearing your cache, using a different browser, and disabling extensions. Let me know if that helps."

✅ **GOOD:**
"That video playback issue is a known bug we're fixing. For now, try this workaround: [specific steps]. We'll have it fixed by [timeframe]."

**Why it's wrong:** If it's a known issue, say so. Don't make them troubleshoot what you already know is broken.

## Anti-Pattern: Not Acknowledging the Bug

❌ **BAD:**
"I'm not able to reproduce this issue. Can you send a screenshot?"

✅ **GOOD:**
"Thanks for reporting this! I've logged it for our team. In the meantime, here's a workaround..."

**Why it's wrong:** "I can't reproduce" feels dismissive. Acknowledge and help regardless.

## Anti-Pattern: No Workaround Offered

❌ **BAD:**
"Our team is aware of this issue and working on a fix."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Known issue! While we fix it, you can [workaround]. I'll email you when the fix is live."

**Why it's wrong:** "Working on it" with no timeline or workaround leaves them stuck.
