I'm getting this message `you must be logged in...`

Tried logging out and putting my email back, click on the newly generated

Can you please help me with this issue?

Hey [NAME],


Gmail was having service issues yesterday, so we were seeing a lot of bounce backs. This resulted in our email processor marking your address as inactive, which prevented any additional emails from being sent to you.


It looks like Gmail is back up today, so you should be able to request login links now. I manually requested one for [EMAIL] and it appears to have been processed and delivered successfully this time. Let me know if that's not the case though.

Hello,

My company got the course for me, but I’m not being able to download the video lessons and the interviews.

When I click on any of them, this appears:

S3 File Zipper. Pass ?ref= to use.

Which value should I pass to the ref? How can I download them?

Best,

[NAME]

Hi [NAME],

I have bought the Online Course to learn / refresh React. Unfortunately there is no subtitle / caption available? Is there a setting for showing the subtitle? I am deaf and I need to have subtitle otherwise it doesn't make the sense to join this course.
Can you help me here?

Thanks and have a good day.

André

André,


Subtitles are available on most lessons. (There are some "welcome" videos without subtitles, which we will work on getting fixed.) There is a bug where subtitle settings are not persisted across lesson views, and must be turned on again for each lesson. We are working on addressing that bug. Thanks for your patience.

Abhay,


We're unable to replicate your error on our side. It's possible it was a temporary or cache issue. Would you try again and let me know if you're still getting the same errors?

I can't see the subtitle option in some of your workshop videos. Is this because
I installed the npm packages incorrectly? I would appreciate it if you could
help me.
```

Hey [NAME],


You should not be installing the workshop app globally.


Please follow the setup instructions described here: https://www.epicreact.dev/get-started


I don't think this should be the cause of the subtitle issues, but it should resolve your local setup issues.
