Hi,

I am reaching out because I am not able to watch videos after logging in.
The 2020 Course update video is loading fine, but the other videos in all
the modules don't load.

Could you take a look?

Thank you.

Hello,

I'm currently using the EpicReact course to learn..well React. I've been watching the videos and suddenly, there is an "Error Loading Content" and none of the videos will load.

I've refreshed my browser multiple times along closing and restarting the window. Is there something else wrong that I am doing here?

Thanks,
Trent Murchison

Hey Trent,


There may be a caching issue preventing you from viewing the course content. Please follow the steps below:



Log out of the course if you're currently logged in

Clear your browser's cache and cookies for https://epicreact.dev/ 

Request a new login link using the "Restore Purchases" button at the top of https://epicreact.dev/ 



Let me know if you're able to view the course as expected after doing that.


If you're able, can you log in using an alternative browser or in incognito mode to see if the issue persists?

Hi,

The video contents are not loading for me. It was loading fine in the last 2
days, but stopped loading suddenly this morning PST time. It also doesn’t show
my previously completed content as completed. (Watch again vs Start Watching)

Hello!

I'm going through the epic react course and I'm using intelliJ Idea
Ultimate --

I'm constantly seeing an error regarding an eslint rule used (picture and
error below)

However, I see that when I run *npx eslint* I am not getting any errors.

I confirmed that intelliJ is using the correct eslint (the one in
*react-fundamentals/node_modules*) and I even tried setting this manually,
but this error isn't going away - I was wondering if you can help, thank
you!

*The error*

Error: Invalid Options:
- Unknown options: reportUnusedDisableDirectives
- 'reportUnusedDisableDirectives' has been removed. Please use the
'overrideConfig.linterOptions.reportUnusedDisableDirectives' option instead.

Hi, since this morning a new exercice has been shown: “Basic JS Hello World”.
When I click it, I got the following messages:

This Serverless Function has crashed.

Your connection is working correctly.

Vercel is working correctly.

500: INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
Code: FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED
ID: cdg1::6qzj5-[PHONE]-[PHONE]

Maybe it is related because my account ([EMAIL] [[EMAIL]]) was created
some time ago (I “abandoned” the course some time ago and I recently started it
again).

I’m enjoying the course. I’ve been working with React like two years ago, for
even large and complex projects, and I’m doing this to learn with more solid
foundations, and even if I’m still in the first lessons, there’s some surprises
yet, so I expect a lot. Good work!
```

Hi Jaime,


We recently had an update which could be causing this. Visit https://www.epicreact.dev/learn to refresh data and It should work. 

If It's still broken please let me know.

I know I tried last week or the week before and received the same error.

Thanks in advance!

Hey Dustin,


Currently, I can see a license for Full Stack Vol 1, and Epic React under [EMAIL], but I'm not seeing Testing JavaScript. 


Could there be another email that might have been used for the purchase? Additional details such as a receipt, purchase date, or the last four digits of the card used for the purchase (along with the expiration date) could also help us track down the license.


Thanks for your patience.


Best,
```

Hi, 


Thanks for the feedback! If it's a persistent issue we recommend cloning the repos locally and using your preferred development environment for the smoothest experience.

The editor is taking ages for me to load, I am not able to run the exercise.
Also, the npm install command hangs sometimes. I have just paid for the course
and I wasn’t expecting this
```

**Answer**

```text
Thanks for the feedback, it's not perfect for sure. We recommend using VS Code or similar locally if the inline editor is aggravating.
```

There is something wrong with the running of the exercises at the moment. It
says “select an exercise file to run” instead of starting running.

Thanks for a great course by the way :D

Hey [EMAIL],


Thanks for the heads up! We're looking into this issue now.

**Question**

Hey dear Epic React Team,
 
I purchased your course last week and wanted to start now. When I tried to play them on my work laptop (Windows 10, Chrome), the videos are buffering for a very long time, sometimes they start playing after minutes, sometimes they don’t. I already tried clearing cache/cookies/etc but it still persists. On my private laptop (Mac, Brave browser) it works. Other websites with videos also work, so it cannot be internet speed. Is there anything else I could try?

Thanks a lot in advance!
 
Best,
Charlotte Bilsing

Hey Charlotte,


We're sorry to hear this is happening. It's something we're looking into. What we can recommend right now is that you continue using your personal laptop, but If that doesn't work we can provide a refund.
