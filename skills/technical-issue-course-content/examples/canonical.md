**Question**

Hello,

I'm currently using the EpicReact course to learn..well React. I've been watching the videos and suddenly, there is an "Error Loading Content" and none of the videos will load.

I've refreshed my browser multiple times along closing and restarting the window. Is there something else wrong that I am doing here?

Thanks,
Trent Murchison

Hey Trent,


There may be a caching issue preventing you from viewing the course content. Please follow the steps below:



Log out of the course if you're currently logged in

Clear your browser's cache and cookies for https://epicreact.dev/ 

Request a new login link using the "Restore Purchases" button at the top of https://epicreact.dev/ 



Let me know if you're able to view the course as expected after doing that.


If you're able, can you log in using an alternative browser or in incognito mode to see if the issue persists?
```

Hello,

I'm trying to access Epic React course but epicreact.dev does not work and
I'm not the only one having this issue.
Attached to this email you can find a screenshot with some of the console
errors that show up.
My course is country restricted but I am in the country from which I bought
the course so that's not the problem.
Also I'm not using a VPN.

Best,
Adrian

Can you please try to log out and back in? We upgraded an authentication library and it looks like it invalidated everybody's token. Sorry about that!

Hey Epic React folks!

Following up on this tweet
<https://twitter.com/TomerAberbach/status/1822318461386666379>. It seems
that when I click on `Basic JS "Hello World"`, it loads for a while, and
then crashes with a 500 error.

Screenshot before clicking:

Some additional information that might help:

   - Any other module I click on seems to work fine.
   - I did some Epic React modules a really long time ago and came back to
   it today. Maybe some of the modules changed after I did some of them and
   that's related?
   - The email address I'm signed up with is [EMAIL]

Let me know if I can provide any other information! Thanks in advance :)

Cheers,
Tomer

Hi,


It seems like there’s a buffer-related error in the player. Could you try clearing your browser cache or updating to the latest version of Chrome? If the problem persists, let me know. 


Best,
