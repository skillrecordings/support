# Variation Examples

## Example 1 (cnv_1jdsv9d1)
**Question:**
```
Hello.

I’m planning on buying 3 more seats for my team, taking advantage of the
discount I have for the Pro version.

I see that on my checkout I have the reference to my old company email
address, where it should be my personal one (updated by your support team
in 2024) and I'm afraid that would be a problem since I no longer have
access to it.

I'm also wondering if buying 3 seats of the Pro version means that mine
(Standard) would be one of them, as an upgrade, or 3 full separate licenses.

Thanks in advance for your help
Best regards,
Vasco Borges

Hey Vasco,


I went ahead and updated your accounts info to be [EMAIL]. Let me know If that works now. 



If you buy 3 new seats you'll have 3 new licenses to assign. You could assign one of them to yourself If you wanted.


Let me know If you need anything else!
