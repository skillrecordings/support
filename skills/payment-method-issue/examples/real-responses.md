Hey Jhonatan,


Thanks for reaching out!


Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do on our end if a card is declined - this is most likely an issue your financial institution will need to address. You may need to clear the charge with them before making another attempt at purchasing.

Hey!

>
I have a corporate credit card:  Citi bank, master card, from the Company I
work for.

For some reason I’m not able to make a purchase of the react course. The
card keeps getting declined - the card itself is okay.

 At the same time payment via the card is the only
way I can pay, I can’t add the corporate card to Apple Pay. And i cant make
wire transfers.

Have you ever had this happen before? do you know any workarounds ?

Hey Paulina,


Looks like It went through! We can't do much on our when a card gets declined, but I'm glad It worked out. 


Let me know If you need anything else.


Best,

Hello! I want to buy the course, but when it comes to pay it doesn't let me. It
always tells me that the card has been rejected.

I have tried with a Mastercard and a Visa card, both with enough money to buy
the course. Both cards work fine as I use them daily.

I don't know if the problem could be because I'm trying to buy it from Spain or
something... but I can't buy it.

Could you help me? Or maybe offer me an alternative payment method?
```

**Answer**

```text
Hey there, 


Your payment attempt is failing because ("The bank returned the decline code do_not_honor, and did not provide any other information. We recommend that your customer contact their card issuer, BANKINTER S.A., for more information, or use another payment method").


Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do on our end - this is most likely an issue your financial institution will need to address. You can also try a different card if you have one.

Hi!

I'm Maggie Appleton, Dan's partner on Just JavaScript. My specialty is taking complex technical concepts and describing them visually through illustrated metaphors.

When someone explains an abstract idea to us, we sometimes respond with “Oh, I see!” or “I see your point of view.” What you are actually looking at is that person’s face, not their idea.

This is slightly strange, but we say it because the concept of visual sight is associated with understanding in our culture.

Seeing is believing, as they say.

You likely spend a lot of time translating abstract ideas and concepts into things you can literally see. Written documents, diagrams, and code syntax are how we make our ideas tangible.

Visual representations help clarify your understanding of a concept. Rather than holding all that information in your head, you externalize it. This makes your ideas explicit and permanent; you’re able to see them for what they are.

However, not all visual representations communicate and clarify in the same way.

Code syntax is a dense visual representation of logic. It’s quick to write and abstract enough to build (almost) anything we want.

But the efficiency of translating abstract ideas into code has trade-offs.

It’s compressed.

Information is left out.

The connections between variables and values aren’t obvious. The flow of data isn’t explicitly diagramed. The order that our syntax is executed isn’t always what we might expect.

With Just JavaScript, Dan and I want to help you understand JavaScript through a set of mental models. Using illustrated diagrams we make the implicit, abstract concepts of JavaScript explicit and visible.

You won’t be working through a lot of hand-wavy computer-sciencey jargon about how computers work or how memory is allocated. Those details can be interesting, but they’re also irrelevant most of the time.

In Just JavaScript the illustrated diagrams don’t directly represent syntax. They represent a set of mental models. An opinionated set. They show you how JavaScript code executes in a practical way. One you’ll be able to use every day you spend coding.



You’ll certainly find them useful. Thousands of other learners already have.

> Hey team,

Just wanted to make an issue I'm facing while processing payment. The
problem I'm facing is, that payment option includes only visa, mastercard,
... But not supporting rupay card for payments( please see the screenshot I
attached). I'm about to make payment but rupay card is not in your list.
Also one more thing, in India , we mostly use UPI mode of payment for
almost all the things, which is very easy mode of payment for us (it will
help make the payment for people in minutes), it will be great if you could
add it. Currently I'm holding this card only,  Or provide any alternate
mode of payment. Please reply as early as possible.Thank you.
```

Hi,


Thanks for reaching out!


We currently only accept payment via credit card through Stripe. We will definitely consider the information you provided about UPI though.

**Question**

Hi Matt,
I'm unable to pay for the course with my Indian cards, as there is a
regulatory step required before it can be charged. I thought stripe had
fixed this, but it throws card declined error. Is there a PayPal link I
could use?

Thanks,

Hi,
I'm trying to buy the "pro testing" package but I get an error. Something
like "Your card is declined".
Can you give me more information ? Is there any issue buying from France ?

Thank you!
```

**Answer**

```text
Hi,


Thanks for reaching out!


I was able to find the credit card failures in our system (Stripe), but the card is being declined with a general "do not honor" error.


There shouldn't be an issue purchasing the course from France. You will most likely need to reach out to your financial institution for more details about why the card is being declined.
