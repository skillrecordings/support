Hey Ilyas,


Per your request we've refunded your most recent course enrollment.


It may take 5-10 business days for the refunded amount to show up in your account, depending on how quickly it's processed by your financial institution.

Hi There,

I recently purchased the Epic React by Kent C. Dodds - Epic React Pro Bundle, however for some reason its purchased 3x licenses when I only required ONE.

Could you please look into this? Invoice #: DC-ER-47489

Hey Lauren,


Sorry for the confusion!


It looks like an additional purchase was made using the email address [EMAIL], and that's why it is included on the invoice. We combine all purchases as separate line items on the invoice we generate.


I've attached the invoice that's directly from Stripe for your purchase, so it only has the 3 licenses included.

Hello there 👋

I accidentally bought another license for this course using the email
[EMAIL] but I already have another one with this email
address.

Could I please get a refund on this purchase 🙂 I surely don't need two
licenses for my personal use.

Also, why does the website not seem to be acting right? For example,
clicking the "Get your invoice" link on the top right doesn't do anything.
I'm having trouble accessing the course.

Thank you.

Hey Kuria,


I've transferred your license to [EMAIL]


Let me know if you have any issues requesting login links using that email address.

the one in 2025.

Hey Daniel,

I accidentally purchased the same JustJavaScript course twice using this
email address: *[EMAIL] <[EMAIL]>*.

I’ve attached the invoices for both purchases. The earlier order was
in *December

Could you please cancel (and refund, if possible) the later order? I’d
really appreciate your help.

Best,
Abhishek
