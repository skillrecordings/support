# Edge Cases

## Example 1 (cnv_99t9ebr)
**Question:**
```
I purchased the bundle twice. I selected PPP by mistake, then made a second purchase without PPP to correct it. I would like to refund the smaller charge and keep the full price one.
```

**Answer:**
```
Got it — we can refund the mistaken PPP purchase and keep the intended one.

Please share the invoice IDs so I can process the correct refund.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_9j9iyrr)
**Question:**
```
I went through the purchase process twice with two cards. The second attempt was charged, and I’m worried the first card got charged too. Can you refund one and give me access?
```

**Answer:**
```
We’ll check both transactions and ensure only one is kept.

Send the purchase email and the last 4 digits of each card, and I’ll verify the charges.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_9m7m2x3)
**Question:**
```
I got an error saying there was an error processing my card. My bank says it went through, and I attempted it twice before calling. Can you help me resolve this?
```

**Answer:**
```
Yes — sometimes a failed checkout still creates a charge.

Please share your email and the approximate time of the attempts so I can check for duplicates and refund if needed.
```
