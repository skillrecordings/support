# Anti-Patterns for Refund Request

## Anti-Pattern: Explaining the Refund Policy First

❌ **BAD:**
"Per our refund policy, refunds are available within 30 days of purchase. Your purchase was on [date]. Since this is within the refund window, I can process your refund."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Refund initiated! You'll see it in your account within 5-10 business days. Sorry the course wasn't the right fit."

**Why it's wrong:** If they're asking for a refund and it's within policy, just do it. Don't lecture about policy first.

## Anti-Pattern: Asking Why They Want a Refund

❌ **BAD:**
"Can you tell me more about why you'd like a refund? We'd love to understand what didn't work for you."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Done! Refund is on its way. If there was something specific that didn't work, I'd love to hear it - but no pressure."

**Why it's wrong:** Requiring justification before processing creates friction and feels interrogative.

## Anti-Pattern: Forgetting the Timeline

❌ **BAD:**
"I've processed your refund."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Refund processed! It typically takes 5-10 business days for banks to reconcile, but you should see it soon."

**Why it's wrong:** Customers will follow up asking "where's my refund?" if you don't set expectations.
