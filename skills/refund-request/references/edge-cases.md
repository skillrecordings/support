## Example 5 (cnv_1jdhe3xh, threadLength: 5)
**Question:**
```
Hello,

I just joined egghead.io 10 minutes ago and I would like to receive a
refund. I did not know the courses I was interested in were only 40 and 21
minutes long.

I don't want to pay 25$ for a content that is barely an hour long. Please
refund my payment.
Sincerely,
[NAME] Ozdemir.
