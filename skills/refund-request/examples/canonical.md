Hello,

I would like to request a refund on my purchase of the Accessibility

I do love this package and its contents but will try to purchase it with my

For now I would like to get a refund since I purchased this using my

I can't wait to start learning, this package looks like the real deal!

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,
Daniel.
