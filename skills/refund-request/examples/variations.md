## Example 4 (cnv_8pgv2h3)
**Question:**
```
Hello there.

I purchased Epic React a couple days back under this e-mail.  I was looking
for more advanced React deep-dive and felt this to be a bit more of an
intro/intermediate level.

I would appreciate a refund.  Also, I was originally double-charged, so if
you could refund both of those charges, that would be great.

Best,

Shane Jeffery
