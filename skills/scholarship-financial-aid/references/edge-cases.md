# Edge Cases

## Example 1: Payment Method Blocked (Not Just Affordability)

**Question:**
```
Hello, I am from Iran and it is difficult for me to pay for the course in one go. Is it possible to pay in installments? I really need this course.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand that payment options can be limited in sanctioned regions.

I've forwarded your request to our team for review. Someone will follow up with you directly to discuss possible options, including alternative payment arrangements if available.

Best,
```

**Why it's an edge case:** Customer mentions sanctions but specifically asks about installments, not free access. Still routes to human due to sanctions/compliance considerations.

## Example 2: Scholarship Request With Promises/Conditions

**Question:**
```
I'm from Afghanistan and cannot afford the course. In return for free access, I promise to: complete the course, provide testimonials, promote to my community. Please consider my application.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out and for your enthusiasm! We appreciate your willingness to contribute back to the community.

I've forwarded your request to our team for review. Someone will follow up with you directly to discuss available options.

Best,
```

**Why it's an edge case:** Customer offers conditions/promises in exchange for access. Don't make commitments about testimonials or promotions - let human team handle negotiation.

## Example 3: Referral from Another Course Creator

**Question:**
```
I'm currently referred by your friend Matt who generously helped me with a laptop to learn coding. He asked me to contact you so that you can enroll me. I'm an orphan from a poor family who is struggling to make a career in Tech.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out and for sharing your story. It sounds like Matt has been supportive of your learning journey.

I've forwarded your message to our team for review. Someone will follow up with you directly.

Best,
```

**Why it's an edge case:** References a specific person (Matt/creator). Human team needs to verify referral and handle appropriately.

## Example 4: Existing PPP Discount But Still Can't Afford

**Question:**
```
Even with the 65% regional discount applied, the price comes to $278, which is about half my monthly salary. I'm writing to kindly ask if it would be possible to receive an additional discount, ideally around 94%, so I could purchase it for $50.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out. We understand that even with regional discounts, the pricing can still be challenging relative to local incomes.

I've flagged your request for review by our team. Someone will follow up with you to discuss possible options.

Best,
```

**Why it's an edge case:** Customer already has PPP but requests further discount. Requires human judgment on whether additional accommodation is appropriate.

## Example 5: Emotional/Distressed Message

**Question:**
```
Banana, discount is awesome, but for a man like me thats from iran, a country that banned by all galaxies, what is your offer? Maybe I should die, I hope some day with helping from people like you, find a remote job.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi there,

I understand your frustration with the restrictions you're facing. We know sanctions create real barriers to accessing educational content.

I've forwarded your message to our team for review. Someone will follow up with you about possible options.

Hang in there - we're rooting for you!
```

**Why it's an edge case:** Emotional language requires compassionate response while still routing to human. Note the encouraging tone without making promises.

## Example 6: Multiple Course Request

**Question:**
```
Dear KenC Dodds, I got a scholarship and took your previous course. Your course is very useful for my work and study. Can I take your other course if possible, because my budget is 50$ per course, that's the highest.
```

**Answer:**
```
Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out! We're glad the previous course has been helpful for your learning.

I've forwarded your request to our team for review. Someone will follow up with you to discuss options for additional courses.

Best,
```

**Why it's an edge case:** Previous scholarship recipient asking for more courses. Human team needs to evaluate ongoing support vs. one-time assistance.
