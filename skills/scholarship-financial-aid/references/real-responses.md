Hello Total TypeScript Team, My name is Eisa Faqiri and I live in Afghanistan. I have been learning JavaScript, and I'm eager to take my skills further by studying your Total TypeScript workshops. I believe your course can really help me level up and contribute more confidently to projects. However, I currently cannot afford the full price of your course. I do not have access to an international credit card to make the payment from here. I am writing to respectfully request if it is possible to grant me free access, a scholarship, or a significant discount so I can enroll in your program. In return, I promise to: * Work hard and complete the course * Give you feedback or testimonials * Share my experience with others in my community * Promote Total TypeScript among developers here

Hey! I'm Baqer from Iran. Recently I've viewed your great course about React & found it a complete one in this field. But due to the sanctions on my country, I can't afford a pro account. I'd really appreciate if I could have an access to courses & learn about testing methods in javascript. Also it's an honor if checkout my Github account.

Good evening. My name is Alexandra, and I successfully started your course last year when there was a discount for Russian users. I was truly excited about the course and eagerly awaited the opportunity to complete it. Unfortunately, I was compelled to move to Armenia and discovered that the course is unavailable in this region. This has been quite disappointing, as I really want to return to my studies and finish the program. I would like to mention that I am genuinely from Russia and can provide documentation to verify my citizenship if needed.

Dear AIHeroTeam, I earnestly want to become your student and learn from your knowledge. But because of the restrictions I'm facing, I can't pay the full cost. That's why I'm writing this email to you in the hope that you can consider my unique situation. I'm from Vietnam. My name is Phuc Thinh. I come from an extremely disadvantaged family where financial difficulties have been a constant challenge. As the primary source of income for my family, I earn between $10 to $13 per month, which is barely enough to cover our basic needs.

Hello Matt, My name is Abdelaziz, a developer from Morocco. I'm a big fan of your work, I watch your videos on YouTube regularly. I'm very interested in purchasing the TypeScript Pro Complete bundle. However, even with the 65% regional discount applied, the price comes to $278, which is about half my monthly salary. Unfortunately, this is beyond what I can afford at the moment. I'm writing to kindly ask if it would be possible to receive an additional discount, ideally around 94%, so I could purchase it for $50.
```

Hello Kent, My name is Milad, and I am a JavaScript developer based in Iran. Due to the current U.S. sanctions, day-to-day life has become increasingly challenging, and my income has been significantly affected. I came across your course and am very interested in joining the MCP workshop. However, the cost is currently beyond my budget, and I'm unable to use PayPal or international credit cards due to the restrictions in place.
