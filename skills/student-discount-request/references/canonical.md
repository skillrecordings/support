# Canonical Examples

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
Hi! I am a full-time student. Do you offer a student discount for this course?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for asking! We do not currently offer a student discount.

If any promotion is running, it will apply automatically at checkout. If you want a lower entry point, you can start with a smaller package and upgrade later by paying the difference.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
I am in university and would love to join, but the price is too high. Any student pricing?
```

**Agent:**
```
I understand. At the moment we do not have student pricing available.

Please keep an eye on the site for promotions, and feel free to ask if you want help choosing a smaller package to start with.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
Do you have a discount code for students? I can provide my student ID.
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for the offer. We are not offering student-specific discounts right now.

If a promo is active, it will be applied automatically at checkout.
```
