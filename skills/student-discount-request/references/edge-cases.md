# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
I am a student in [COUNTRY] and cannot use the current payment method. Can I get free access?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for reaching out. We do not offer free access or student discounts at this time.

If a promotion is active it will apply automatically at checkout. Let me know if you want help finding a smaller package to start with.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
I bought the standard package with a student code years ago. Can you apply that discount to the Pro upgrade?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not have a student discount to apply, but upgrades are priced as the difference between your current package and the new package at the time of upgrade.

If you want, share the email you purchased with and I can confirm your upgrade options.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
My school will reimburse me if I have a formal student discount invoice. Can you provide one?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not issue student-discount invoices, but we can provide a standard receipt for your purchase.

If your school needs a formal invoice, share the billing details and we can help.
```
