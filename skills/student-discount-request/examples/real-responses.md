Hello,
I am a full time student at the University of North Texas.

Is there any discount on the 'epic react pro' license?

thank you,
```

Hey Andrew,


Thanks for your interest in the course!


We aren't currently offering any discounts. However, if you're able to start out with either the Basic or Standard package now, you'll have the opportunity to upgrade to the Pro package whenever you're ready. The price to upgrade will be the difference in price between whichever package you start with and the price of the Pro package at the time you upgrade.


The upgrade option is only available to move up to the Pro Testing package from whichever level you start on. So you can upgrade from Basic or Standard to Pro, but not from Basic to Standard as a half-step.

Hi,

Is there an option for a discounted student rate? I’m at university and really want access to this course, but I just can’t afford it. 

I can prove I’m enrolled and have access to an education email address (.ac.uk) if this helps. 

Thank you,

Luke Broad

Unfortunately I couldn't make nearly the impact that I wanted by giving live workshops. It just cost too much of my time and energy, and therefore could only be accessible to people with extremely deep pockets (or employers with deep pockets).

In that case, this is the last promo email you'll be getting from me about it, (but don't worry, I'll still email you blog posts when I publish them). If you haven't, please give it a shot. I know you'll love it (and there's a 30 day money back guarantee, just to give you peace of mind). And share it with your friends. Tell them why you bought it, and what you think it will do for you and your career. Thanks again!

We don't currently offer any discounts for Epic React. However, if you're able to start with either the Basic or Standard package now, you'll have the opportunity to upgrade to the Pro package in the future. The cost to upgrade will be the difference in pricing between your initial purchase tier and the price of the Pro package at the time you upgrade.


The upgrade option is only available to move up to the Pro package from whichever level you start on. So you can upgrade from Basic or Standard to Pro, but not from Basic to Standard as a half-step.

Dear Kent C. Dodds

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Nidhi Soni, and I am a student
currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science in India.

I came across your course, *Epic React Tutorial*, on epicreact.dev and was
very interested in enrolling. Unfortunately, as a student, I’m unable to
afford the full cost of the course at this time. I was wondering if you
might offer any scholarship, free audit options, or financial aid for
learners in need. I would greatly appreciate any support you could provide
to help me access this valuable learning material.

Thank you for considering my request. I admire your work and would be
grateful for the opportunity to learn from this course. Please let me know
if there’s any additional information needed from my side.

Best regards,

*Nidhi Soni*
