Hi EpicAI team,

I have purchased the course, and I can't wait to go through the material,
but I can't access it. When I click to enter the lessons, I automatically
get redirected back to the homepage, please check the video attached.

Can you help me?

Thank you,
Sanja

Hey Sanja,


We got this fixed by removing the start learning button from the page It's broken on. It was added before other features. 


Should be all good to go now! Thanks for letting us know.


Best,

Hi Team,

First of all I would like to thank the team for putting up such a wonderful
course, so addictive that I even look to upskill during the weekend. I had
purchased Epic React v1 and was cruising through when suddenly I am locked
out of all my content and a paywall is asking me to pay for the pro
version.

I have attached the image for the same along with this email. Can you guys
kindly look into this? And help provide an appropriate resolution.

Thanks in advance for your help.
```

**Answer**

```text
Hey Bharat,


It looks like you bought the course using the regional discount. This can happen if you're using a VPN or anything that might move your location from the place you bought It (India). 


If that's not the case let me know and we can look more into It!


I've sent you a new login link as well. You should be able to access the course through 'My Products' → 'Manage & Details' → 'modules'
```

Hi Matt,

I cannot access the Pro Workshop content. I am getting errors on the screenshots. I tried cleaning the cache. logging out and logging in again and checking that in my purchase history, I can still see that Complete Volume is still there.

Is there any ongoing maintenance?

Best,
Fatih

Hi. I can’t continue with the course. I purchased the whole package for 400.
After logging in using Github I can’t play any videos anymore because it keeps
asking me to buy the course. Sometimes the check marks for completed lessons
show lock icons instead.

**Question**

```text
Hi there, I bought access to totaltypescript website. And even almost
finish first chapter. But now, for some reason, all the chapters are
locked. With this msg.

[image: image.png]

Even those lessons that I've already finished.

The only thing is, that I bought the course using regional discount as it
was possibility to buy like this since I'm from Ukraine.

Is it normal behavior, or is it some kind of bug.
```

**Answer**

```text
You can upgrade to an unrestricted license or we can refund your purchase if your location hasn't changed and you feel like this is being applied in error. 


We aren't able to provide support around why your system might provide different geolocation data. It's based on IP addresses and is an imperfect system. Currently there are no other reports of issues and it's working as expected for most users.
