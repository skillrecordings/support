Hi,

I have purchased the epic react course a year ago with this exact email, but when I login and try to watch the courses the only option I can see is to buy them again. Could you please help me on this ?

Best regards,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


There may be a caching issue preventing you from viewing the course content. Please follow the steps below:



Log out of the course if you're currently logged in

Clear your browser's cache and cookies for https://epicreact.dev/ 

Request a new login link using the "Restore Purchases" button at the top of https://epicreact.dev/ 



Please note that the login link expires after one use, so if you log out you will need to request a new login link.


Let me know if you're able to view the course as expected after doing that or if the issue persists.
```

Hey! I recently purchased the Epic React Course. The email that I received
mentioned that I will be logged in to the webapp for 60 days. So does that
mean that I won't be able to re-login after that and won't be able to
access the content?

Thanks,
[NAME] Siddiqui

Hey [NAME],


The 60 days message means that you will need to request a new magic link after 60 days.


You can access the course using the "Restore Purchases" button at the top of https://epicreact.dev. You'll need to enter the email address you used to purchase the course to have a login link sent.

Hey,

I’ve been very busy with work over the past couple of months, but I now
have time to continue with the Epic AI MCP course. However, I can’t access
it anymore.

In September, I purchased Epic AI MCP Cohort 1. When I click *“*Start
learning*”*, I briefly see the course, but then it redirects back to
the *“*Enroll
now*”* page.

One more thing: I previously had an issue with the payment and ended up
purchasing the course twice. One of the payments was refunded/credited by
you. Could that be the reason why I’m experiencing this access issue?

Could you please check my account and restore my access?
Kind regards,
[NAME]

Hey there,

I recently purchased access to the next cohort, and I have a question.
Wasn't it supposed to unlock the AI SDK Crash Course as well?

Hi,

I'm unable to see my purchased epic react course?

I'm also unable to run npm run setup locally.

It used to work. Not any more.

Hey [NAME],


I wasn't able to find a license associated with this email address ([EMAIL]) – is it possible it was purchased using a different one?


You'll need to enter the email address you used to purchase the course when requesting a login link.


If you're not sure which email address the license belongs to, I can look it up using your payment information. I just need the last four digits and expiration date of the credit card that was used.
