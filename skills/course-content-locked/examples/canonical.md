Good night team,

I'd like to request your help, I just purchased the epic react pro course
with the power parity pricing discount, but when I received the email to
log in, the link sends me back to the same page where you purchase the
course (https://epicreact.dev) and I'm unable to see the content of the
course.

Please let me know if I'm missing anything, or if there is anything else I
need to do.

Thank you in advance for your help!

regards,
[NAME] Pineda

Hey [NAME],


It sounds like this may be a caching issue. Please follow the steps below:



Click the logout icon on the right at the top of the page - it looks like a door with an arrow pointing out

Clear your browser's cache and cookies for https://epicreact.dev/

Request a new login link using the "Restore Purchases" button at the top of https://epicreact.dev/



Let me know if you're able to view your invoice and the course content after doing that.
```

Hi,

I’m having trouble logging into my recently purchased Epic React course.

You send me the link, I click it and it just goes back to the page that I purchased the course on.

Can you please help me out?

Thanks,

Hey [NAME],

I just purchased the Pro version and have signed in, but I have no idea how
to access the content. After signing in I'm still on the landing page, and
there is nothing new.

Can you help me find the testing content?

Best,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


You can access the course using the email login link at the top of https://testingjavascript.com. You'll need to enter the email address you used to purchase the course to have a login link sent.


Once you're logged in, you should see "Access your Pro Testing course" at the top of the page, with the course content beneath it.


If you've done that, but still don't see content there may be a caching issue. Please follow the steps below:



Click the "logout" link

Clear your browser's cache and cookies for http://testingjavascript.com/

Request a new login link using the "email login link" button at the top of http://testingjavascript.com/



Let me know if you're able to view the course content after doing that.

Hello,

I got the testing course from my work and all worked fine but when I try to load content on the website recently I only get previews displayed.

This is my current access link: https://testingjavascript.com/#access_token=oe1bK8WPD390lOogzn6CZTzkgXyt1WbilqGsKDG7Ar4&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=[PHONE]

Could you please help me with that?

Kind regards

I have manually requested a login link for [EMAIL] and it was processed and delivered successfully from our side.


Let me know if you don't see that one in your inbox or spam folder, or if you have any trouble requesting login links in the future.
