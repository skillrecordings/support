I just purchased the Pro Workshop and I see an Expert Interview at the
bottom, it seems I still need to subscribe to access the interview, I just
cannot see where I should subscribe to?

Thanks!

Hey [NAME],


The interviews are the bonus content left out when using the regional discount. You would need a full license to see the interviews.


Let me know If you have anymore questions!


Best,

I bought this course in July 10, 2023

why can’t I access the v1 lessons now? I don’t want to upgrade now, is there a
way to access my v1 lessons?
```

**Answer**

```text
Hey,


What do you see when you try to access V1 lessons? 



Looks like you own a region restricted license. If you're In the correct region with no VPN on you'll be able to access V1 through your products page or directly here https://www.epicreact.dev/learn 


Let me know If that works for you!


Best,

Hello, I’ve purchased a regional access for $278 but I was left with the
impression that for this price I will be able to access something but instead
everything is locked and I can see only the preview of the course. My question
is “What exactly I receive for the price of $278?“

Best regards,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


I've transferred you license to [EMAIL]. Let me know If you run into any issues with that.


Also to answer your previous email about being blocked access. You should have access to all the content. You'll only not have access to bonus content like the expert interviews. 


Let me know If you still aren't able to access the course.


Best,
```

Greetings, 

I just purchased Mega bundle and I’m trying to access React related workshops and Bonus sections, but the site won’t give me access to the lessons. I will attach screenshots of the content showing on my end (sections with no lesson numbers underneath are not accessible) and what the bundle includes for reference.

Thanks,
[NAME]

You'll have to login to Testing Javascript and Epic React separately from Epic Web. Once logged In you should see all the content though! Let me know If you're having issues logging In.
