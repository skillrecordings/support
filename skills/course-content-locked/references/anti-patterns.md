# Anti-Patterns for Locked Content

## Anti-Pattern: Blaming the Customer

❌ **BAD:**
"It looks like you only purchased the basic tier which doesn't include this module."

✅ **GOOD:**
"That module is part of the Pro tier. I can upgrade you for the difference ($XX) if you'd like access. Or happy to answer questions about what's included!"

**Why it's wrong:** Make the path forward easy, not accusatory.

## Anti-Pattern: Not Checking First

❌ **BAD:**
"You need to purchase the course to access this content."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Let me check... looks like there was a sync issue with your account. Fixed! Try refreshing and you should have full access now."

**Why it's wrong:** Often it's a bug, not a purchase issue. Check before assuming.

## Anti-Pattern: No Clear Upgrade Path

❌ **BAD:**
"That content is for Pro tier only."

✅ **GOOD:**
"That's in the Pro tier! To upgrade: [direct link]. The difference from your current tier is $XX. Includes [benefits]."

**Why it's wrong:** Make buying easy. Don't make them hunt for upgrade options.
