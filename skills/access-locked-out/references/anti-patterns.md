# Anti-Patterns for Access Locked Out

## Anti-Pattern: Asking Them to "Try Again"

❌ **BAD:**
"Please try logging in again and let me know if it still doesn't work."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Looks like your access expired because [reason]. I've restored it - here's your login link: [link]"

**Why it's wrong:** They already tried. They need you to fix it, not try again.

## Anti-Pattern: Not Explaining Why

❌ **BAD:**
"I've restored your access."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Your access was locked because your payment method expired. I've unlocked it and extended for 30 days while you update your payment info."

**Why it's wrong:** Without context, it might happen again. Help them prevent recurrence.

## Anti-Pattern: Policy-First Response

❌ **BAD:**
"Access to our courses requires an active subscription. Your subscription ended on [date]..."

✅ **GOOD:**
"Got you back in! Your subscription had lapsed but I've reactivated it. Here's your login: [link]"

**Why it's wrong:** Lead with the solution, not the policy.
