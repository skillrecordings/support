Hey I have an issue to login: Since iPhone used the email forwarding, I
don't see the course when I logged in as [EMAIL]

https://www.epicai.pro/invoices/mc_aa66c86e-2a5c-4761-9b9d-eb04ab275e8c
here is the invoice which shows the email forwarding address: "Invoice For
[NAME] Linnanen
[EMAIL]"

Can you fix so that the course is enrolled with [EMAIL]?

Thanks,

Hey [NAME],


Are you using any type of VPN or trying to login outside of India? It looks like you bought the regional discount license so that might be blocking you. 


Let me know If thats not the issue!

Hi,

I purchased your course using an email address I no longer have access to, and
now I’m completely locked out. Since your system sends credentials and recovery
options only to that old email, I can’t access the content I paid for.

This has been very frustrating, especially because I was recently laid off and
the content of the course could really help me improve my skills and increase my
chances of getting a job sooner — but instead, I’m stuck without access.

Please let me know how I can update my email and regain access as soon as
possible. I’d really appreciate your help.

Thanks in advance,
[NAME] Umbelino

Hey [NAME],


We always recommend the license being under a personal address. I got the license transferred over to [EMAIL] from [EMAIL]. 


Let me know If you have any issues with logging In or If you'd like It under a different email! You'll be able to access the workshops here once logged In https://www.epicreact.dev/learn

Hey [NAME],


I'm not seeing any purchase history under the email [EMAIL]. Could It be under a different email?

Hey guys, I purchased the previous Epic React course, but I can’t access it.
When I navigate to “My Products” page it says “You haven't purchased any Epic
React products yet” which is false. Please, assist.

It's true for this email address at least. You have a purchase related to epicweb.dev.
