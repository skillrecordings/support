Hi,

I recently bought the full Total TypeScript course while I was in
Uzbekistan and I was able to access it there. I am now back in the UAE, and
my access suddenly stopped.

Could you please restore my access or allow login from the UAE? I can
provide my account/email and proof of purchase if needed.

Thank you,
[NAME]

Hello, 


We've initiated a refund. It can take 5-10 days for the banks to reconcile and return the money to your account.

Hello!

I am having issues seeing the two channels messaged in this thread on
discord:
https://discord.com/channels/[PHONE]731931/[PHONE]731934/[PHONE][PHONE]

I have followed the instructions and validated that the epicai account
where I can see the paid invoice is also the same epicai account that I
have connected to Discord (br1ce). Please let me know if there is anything
else I must do.

Thanks in advance for your help!

This is my 2nd request… I paid for the testingjavascript.com
[http://testingjavascript.com] materials, but I can’t access them any longer.

It looks like I’m supposed to do an upgrade, but I don’t want to pay again, I
would like to have access to the materials I paid for, even if they are not
upgraded / updated

Hey [NAME],


Sadly I still don't see anything even under [EMAIL]. I'm not sure what happened to the license, but I trust you did pay for It so I'll go ahead and give you a new license to assign to any email you'd like.

Enjoy the course!

Hello KCD Dream Team,

I think I purchased the course, but I got this error message. When I log in
via my Github ([EMAIL]), I don't see my course available. Can
you assist?

Thanks,

[NAME]

Hi [NAME], 


Can you tell me more about where you're having trouble? In the actual "https://www.epicai.pro/" website or the workshop app locally? Just trying to understand your context because I'm not getting these type of requests. I logged in as you and you have access to all the lessons and workshops.
