Hi,

I purchased the Epic React Pro course on October, 7th, 2024 using the email
address: [EMAIL].

I still have the original welcome Email by Kent as well as the Magic Login
Link. I tried to login again today at https://www.epicreact.dev/. However,
when I enter my Email Address, nothing happens apart from the URL changing
to:


https://www.epicreact.dev/login?callbackUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epicreact.dev%2F&error=EmailSignin

So it looks like there is an error, but it's not displayed on the page so I
don't know what's wrong. Checking my Inbox, the last time I logged into the
course was on February, 5th 2025.

Could you please be so kind and have a look. I finally got around taking
the course and would like to begin as soon as possible.

Thanks,

[NAME] Heinsen

Hey [NAME],


Sorry about the wait time! Is this still an issue for you? On my end It looks like you should be able to login. If It's still having issues try to request a new login link here https://www.epicreact.dev/login 


Let me know.


Best,
```

Hey folks,

I am not sure if you will be able to assist me. I signed up for epic react
a few years ago and used my work email address, which I no longer have
access to after being laid off. The email used was
[EMAIL] (or maybe @a8c.com). I might be able to
provide the last four of the credit card used if that helps.

I'm just looking to get back into the courses and go through them again.

Thank you,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


Looks like It was under [EMAIL]. I've transferred your license to [EMAIL] 


Let me know if you have any issues requesting login links using that email address.

Hello,
I've been greatly enjoying the typescript workshops, however, suddenly I'm
unable to log in! And consequently unable to access any of the material.
I've tried multiple login links but nothing works.

I attached the invoice of my purchase to confirm my access. Please help me!

Thanks,
[NAME]
