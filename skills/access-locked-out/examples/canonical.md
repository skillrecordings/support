Hi,

I purchased Total TypeScript a few weeks ago but I can't figure out
how to access it. When I try to log in it says my email isn't
recognized.

I used this email ([EMAIL]) for the purchase and I have
the receipt from Stripe.

Can you help me get access to my course?

Thanks,
Joel

I couldn't find an account or purchase associated with this email. 
What email address did you use when you bought your product? It's possible you used a different one.

Hello, I purchased access to this course a while back, but it looks like I no
longer have access to the training courses. Does the subscription have an
expiration date? If not, how can I regain access without paying again? Thank you
```

**Answer**

```text
Hey,


You should still have access. No expiration on the subscription. 


I'm not seeing anything under [EMAIL]. Could It be under a different email?

I remember purchasing the course sometime within the last three months, under my
email address but cannot locate the product details nor login credentials.

Would you be able to assist?

Hey,


Totally! I'm not seeing anything under [EMAIL]. Do you have another email address I could check?


If you have the last four digits and expiration on the card used to make the purchase I can search for that as well. 


Let me know!


Best,

Hey,


I'm not seeing anything under [EMAIL]. Do you have another email I could check? I can also search for the billing info like the last 4 digits and expiration date on the card you used to purchase.


Let me know.

seems i lost access to the course already bought. I tried to login with github
instead of email and maybe that was the reason
