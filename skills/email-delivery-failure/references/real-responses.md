Hi [NAME],



I'm thrilled to work with you! I want to let you know of a few things you'll need to know so we can make the most of the time we have together for the CSS Gymnastics for UI Enhancement Workshop. I know you're busy, so I'll try to keep it brief.



We use Zoom for video. You will need to have it installed on the computer you will be using on the day of the workshop.



There will be two 15-minute coffee breaks during the workshop. We will get the workshop going right away. You will have the option to set up the workshop repository or follow along using the workshop site:

Workshop repository: https://github.com/pro-tailwind/workshop-gymnastics

Workshop site: https://workshop-gymnastics-pro-tailwind.vercel.app/

Hello,

I just purchased the pro package of the epic react course and can see that
payment went through.

However I've not received the confirmation email in my inbox yet. I've also
checked my spam folder and there is nothing.

Could you please assist me with this? I need the confirmation email asap as
I'd like to submit my receipt before the office closes for the holidays.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Regards,
[NAME]

Hey [NAME],


Our email processor was experiencing issues on Friday and into the weekend, so login links were being sent out much later than when they are requested.


Everything should be back up and running now - please try to request a new login link and let me know if you still don't receive it.


Once you're logged in, you can view a fully customized invoice here: https://epicreact.dev/invoice. From there, you can add any required information to the "Prepared for" section of the invoice.


I apologize for the inconvenience!

Good evening,

This afternoon I purchased the Just JavaScript course. The confirmation
page said that I would receive an email from this address with a link to
access the course but I have still not received it.

Additionally, if you could please send me the receipt, that would be
awesome!

Thank you,
[NAME]
