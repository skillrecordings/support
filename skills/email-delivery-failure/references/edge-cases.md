# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
I used my work email and the company email filters might be blocking you.
```

**Agent:**
```
That can happen. Please ask your IT team to allowlist [SENDER_DOMAIN].

If you want, I can also switch the account to a different email once you provide it.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
I accidentally typed the wrong email at checkout and never got the link.
```

**Agent:**
```
No problem. Please share the incorrect email and the correct one. I will update the account and resend the access email.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
I tried requesting the login link several times and nothing arrives.
```

**Agent:**
```
Sorry about that. Please confirm your email and I will manually send a fresh login link.

Also check spam and any email filters in case they are blocking it.
```
