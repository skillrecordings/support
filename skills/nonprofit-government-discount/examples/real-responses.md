I’m IK, and I am currently serving in a governmental agency. I am interested in
procuring testing accessibility learning resources and was wondering if there
are any pricing options available specifically tailored for government or
non-profit organizations.

Could you please provide me with information regarding the pricing structure and
any potential discounts or programs offered for governmental or non-profit
entities? Additionally, if there are any specific procedures or documentation
required for availing such pricing options, please do let me know.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt
response.

As much as I’d like to help, unfortunately, we don't offer any discounts for government or non-profit organizations.


I hope you’ll still consider enrolling. If you have any other questions or if there’s anything else I can assist you with, please let me know.

they are the same invoice as the one you've got access to so you can make a copy of it two times and edit the invoice pdfs to suit your needs.

Hi Simon,

Keen to take part in the Multi-Theme Strategy with Tailwind CSS workshop…

But I currently work for a non-profit who probably won’t pay for the workshop… so will be coming out of my personal funds!

Is there anything you could do? 

Find your tutorials on YouTube very helpful - keep up the great work!

Many thanks,

Craig

Hello!


We’re looking to buying 10 seats for your course for our organization and were curious if you offer non-profit/charity pricing or pricing in Canadian dollars?


Thank you,

Thanks for your interest in the course!


We don't offer non-profit/charity pricing. However, if you use the "For Teams" option to purchase 10 seats there is an automatic 10% bulk discount applied.

Good afternoon,

We would like to purchase for a colleague the training course "Master React 19 with Code Focused Workshops", but as we are a public institution - Vilnius City Municipality Administration, we can only purchase the services on the basis of payment by invoice. Would it be possible to receive an invoice and get access to the training after payment by bank transfer?
Also, if a colleague from our institution were to attend, what contact details would be required to ensure a smooth connection to the lecture?


Respectfully,

Hey Monika,


We can't invoice for the PPP discount. You'll have to use the self checkout option and select the regional discount checkmark: https://www.epicreact.dev/buy 


After purchase you will get an invoice with an option to edit.


I can go ahead and create an invoice before purchase but It would be full price.

Hi Management Team for Epic React,

I'm the head of the tech team for Acumen.org, we manage https://acumenacademy.org.

In our End of Year planning, Epic React was the most requested training course by our 5 developers.

The cost of the course, however, is beyond our individual training budgets.

I wanted to ask a few questions:

  1.  Do you offer courses or special pricing for Nonprofits that we can leverage?
  2.  Would you consider an in-kind trade? We host a range of courses for change creators and emerging leaders. Whilst the overwhelming majority of them are free, we do have a subset of courses by various thought leaders that are charged. Would your team consider a cost per cost trade ... we can create coupon codes for your team in the same amount as with your course.

We would be seeking 5 licenses:

  1.  2 x in Lagos, Nigeria
  2.  2 x in Nairobi, Kenya
  3.  1 x in Fresno, USA

You can see more on Acumen and our mission here:

  *   Acumen from our partners perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fjlVkMOD2M
  *   Acumen's mission:  https://acumen.org/manifesto/

Thanks for your time and consideration,

Hey Joshua,


Apologies again for the delay!


Here are two coupons to buy the course at the regionally discounted prices:


Kenya (50% discount) - https://epicreact.dev?coupon=[REDACTED]
Nigeria (70% discount) - https://epicreact.dev/?coupon=[REDACTED]


Each coupon can be used to purchase the course two times, and they'll both expire if not used within a month.


Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else!

Hi Kent, I love your work!



I am excited for your course on React 19. I was thinking of getting it for
myself, but wondering if you have extra discounts for NGO’s.



My team at Enveritas works hard trying to eradicate poverty and misery for small
farmers around the World, and we're a group of 5 frontend developers that often
reference your work on our decision making - so perhaps partially our success is
thanks to you!

I would love to help bring my team to the next level, and I can say sincerely if
it's not possible to get access to my team, I understand! I would still purchase
it for myself ❤️



Thanks again for all the knowledge you've provided!

Cheers!

RMIT Classification: Trusted

Hi team,

My name is Hien, currently Library Teaching and Instruction Coordinator from RMIT University Vietnam. I'm very interested in the offers on web accessibility available on your website here Buy Testing Accessibility<https://testingaccessibility.com/buy>.

I have 2 questions that maybe you can help me with. Would you please advise if 'seats' apply to the Core option (as our team may not need the Professional option)? Also, is it possible to purchase seats for the Core license and apply the reginal pricing?

I look forward to your reply. Thank you.

Best regards,
Hiên

Hello,


For teams seats you can only buy Professional and there Isn't a PPP discount. 


Your best option would be to buy 2 individual PPP Core licenses!


Best,
