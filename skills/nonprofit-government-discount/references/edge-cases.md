# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
We are a registered nonprofit and can provide documentation. Can you extend a discount?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for offering. We do not have a nonprofit discount program at this time.

If a promotion is active it will apply automatically.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
We need a formal quote for a government purchase. Can you discount it?
```

**Agent:**
```
We cannot apply special government pricing. If you need a formal invoice, share the billing details and we can help.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
Can you match the education discount for our nonprofit team?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not have nonprofit discounts at the moment.

If you want help choosing a smaller package or a team option, let me know.
