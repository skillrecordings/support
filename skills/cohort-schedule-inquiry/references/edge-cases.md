# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
I am in [TIMEZONE] and cannot attend the live sessions. Is that a problem?
```

**Agent:**
```
Not at all. Recordings are available so you can follow along asynchronously.

If you share the cohort you are interested in, I can confirm how recordings are delivered.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
If I miss week one, can I still join in week two?
```

**Agent:**
```
Yes, you can still join and catch up with the recordings.

If you want, I can share the best place to start once you are in.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
Do you take breaks for holidays or does the schedule shift?
```

**Agent:**
```
If there are any schedule adjustments, they are posted on the cohort page and in the cohort announcements.

Let me know which cohort you are looking at and I can confirm.
```
