Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Kiran, and I am a
cybersecurity researcher. During my recent analysis of your web
application, I identified several security vulnerabilities that require
immediate attention.

Could you please confirm if this is the correct email address to share
detailed reports on these issues?

Additionally, I would like to inquire whether you have an active bug bounty
program or reward system for valid security reports. I would appreciate any
information you could provide on this matter.

Kind regards,
Kiran

Hey guys, 

I am talking your epic course.
You have an incident!

One of your videos leaks the full API KEY for OPEN AI.
This can lead to unexpected costs.

Delete it immediately!
See screenshot below.
It is on 2:50 MCP UI, Advanced, 01 Tool Result, Solution

Hope I could help.

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds everyone well and productive. During my recent
assessment of your website as an experienced ethical hacker, I discovered
some critical vulnerabilities that could pose a security risk.

If your company offers rewards or a bug bounty program for identifying such
issues, I’d appreciate it if you could provide more information.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
```

Yesterday, a guy succeeded to hack around in the Network Tab in Chrome and
managed to gain access to TTS for free.

Today, he came back and said he'd found a way to scrape all our MUX data
and download the videos:

I haven't masked all the media IDs so this isn't news. 


That's on the todo list, but not at the top of it.


It's pretty trivial to scrape data and download videos. Everything I've ever done is available on some Russian website.


If they pull the monorepo and run the handy docker container for a dev database they can also view everything that way easily if that's his update tomorrow!

Hi Kent

I might have found an exploit/bug on your site. If I go to team licenses
and enter 1000000000000000000 (1 with 18 zeros a.k.a. a quintillion) and
then click on pay, I get the stripe popup and ‘only’ have to pay $0.09. I
don’t know if this would actually go through in your backend, but I thought
it’s better to let you know instead of paying 9 cents and possibly bricking
your server(s).

Vincent

Hi, I talked with Matt and was told to send you guys an email regarding a
security vulnerability I found.

When accessing a video, the tRPC call abilities.getAbilities
[image: image.png]

And you inspect the response:
[image: image.png]

The muxPlaybackId is present, which makes it very easy to download the
video by just exchanging the video ID in the stream URL. "
https://stream.mux.com<MuxPlaybackId>.m3u8?redundant_streams=true"

To verify this issue you can use yt-dlp. Pick any video when logged out,
and replace the <ID> in the following command:

*yt-dlp --all-subs -f mp4 -o "video.mp4" "https://stream.mux.com/
<https://stream.mux.com/><ID>.m3u8?redundant_streams=true"*

Best regards, Max.

What's going to make me sad is when somebody emails with "you can watch everything for free in dev lol" https://github.com/skillrecordings/products/blob/main/apps/total-typescript/README.md


It's "obfuscated" at the level it is at because it's convenient and doesn't have a significant material effect on the product as a business. Sites like Course Hunter publish everything as well, so over the years I've built these sites to balance the ergonomics of development. Kind of lazy.


Thankfully most folks will make the honest choice, but if you took the time and effort to understand the system and fill your local hard drive with some gigabytes of videos because you want/need to?


Enjoy!


All of the code is here too: https://github.com/orgs/total-typescript/repositories

*Hello Team,*

I am a security researcher and would like to responsibly disclose a
vulnerability I discovered on your domain. This issue allows email
spoofing, which could be exploited to impersonate your organization and
target your users or customers.


*DESCRIPTION:*I just sent a forged email to my email address that appears
to originate from [EMAIL] I was able to do this because of the
following :

DMARC record lookup and validation for epicreact.dev

 “No DMARC Record found”
And/ OR
"DMARC Quarantine/Reject policy not enabled"


*Fix:*1) Publish DMARC Record.  (If not already Published)
2)Enable DMARC Quarantine/Reject policy
3)Your DMARC record should look like
"v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=none; pct=100; ri=86400; rua=mailto:[EMAIL]"

*And*

As I have seen the SPF and TXT record for the  epicreact.dev  which is :


Found v=spf1 record for epicreact.dev:
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all


so valid record will look like :


Found v=spf1 record for epicreact.dev:

v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com -all




*What's the issue :*
What’s the issue: as u can see in the article difference between softfail
and hardfail you should be using fail as Hardfail as it doesn’t allow
anyone to send spoofed emails from your domains, In current SPF record you
should replace (?) or

(~) with (-) at last before all , - is strict which prevents all spoofed
emails except if you are sending

You can validate by testing yourself over here: mxtoolbox.com

This can be done using any php mailer tool like this ,

<?php
$to = "[EMAIL]";
$subject = "Password Change";
$txt = "Change your password by visiting here - [VIRUS LINK HERE]l";
$headers = "From:  [EMAIL]";
mail($to,$subject,$txt,$headers);
?>

*IMPACT:*

Without proper SPF and DMARC enforcement:

Malicious actors can send phishing emails pretending to be from your domain.

Victims may receive links to fake password reset pages, malware downloads,
or fraudulent instructions.

*Note:* I’m hoping to receive a bounty reward for my current finding. I
will be looking forward to hearing from you on this and will be reporting
other vulnerabilities accordingly.

Kind Regards,

*James*

**Question**

```text
Hey Kent,

I played around with the bulk discounts for the course. Turns out, if you
enter 100000000000000000 as the amount of licenses to buy, stripe switches
its price to 0.01$, and lets you pay successfully. The request is then sent
to the egghead.io API, which returns a 500.

Hope that helps.

Best
Alex
