# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
I am halfway through and still lost. Can I get a refund?
```

**Agent:**
```
I am sorry it is not working for you. If you want to proceed with a refund, I can help.

Please confirm the email used to purchase and I will take care of it.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
I only know [TECH]. Is this course still a fit?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for sharing. It depends on the specific prerequisites for this course.

Tell me what you are comfortable with and I can suggest whether to start here or with a more foundational course.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
This seems too easy. Is there a more advanced track?
```

**Agent:**
```
If you are looking for a deeper challenge, I can recommend the more advanced course or bundle. Share your goals and I will point you to the best next step.
```
