# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
My licensing board requires CEUs with a provider ID. Do you have one?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not have a provider ID or CEU accreditation.

If a completion certificate is acceptable, we can provide that after you finish the course.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
Can you list the number of hours for the workshop so I can submit them?
```

**Agent:**
```
We can share the estimated runtime and provide a completion certificate, but we do not issue accredited CEUs.

Let me know which workshop you are referring to.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
My employer needs a signed letter verifying attendance.
```

**Agent:**
```
We can provide a completion certificate. If you need a signed letter with specific details, share the requirements and we will see what we can do.
```
