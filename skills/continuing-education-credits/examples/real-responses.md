Hi

I am in conversation with the IAAP about using these courses towards my
continuing education credits (to maintain my CPACC certification). The problem
is, they really need to know how long the training takes so they can assign the
right number of credits.

Can you help please? For example, let me/them know how long each workshop is?

Hey [NAME],


Sorry, I was splitting the total average. Tracking your own times Is probably best right now. 



Also, [NAME] Is working with the certification team at IAAP so we can give correct and accurate credits per workshop. 


Let me know If you need anything else.


Best,
```

Hello!

I work on the certification team at IAAP, reviewing education credit requests.  I got this question today:  can you tell me how many CAEC credits this course is worth please? It has taken me 20 hours to complete but is self paced. It is unclear how many I could submit a claim for.

We typically go off the # of hours documented on the website or on a certificate of completion.  I don't see anything like that on your website.  Do you have a suggestion on what we should award for your 6 workshops?

  1.
Foundations of Accessibility
  2.
Design Thinking and People Skills for Accessibility
  3.
Manual Accessibility Testing
  4.
Semantic markup with HTML and ARIA
  5.
Coding Accessible Interactions and Mechanics
  6.
Automated Accessibility Testing

Some examples from other providers:

  *
We award 15 credits (total of 45) for the DHS trusted tester
  *
Deque has the # of credits earned on each of their course completion certificates.

Any thoughts you have would be greatly appreciated.

Hi [NAME],

I work with the certification team at IAAP. I have a certification holder who is
asking if we award education credits for your workshops. After reviewing your
website, it definitely seems like something we’d want to do. We usually try to
get an idea of duration of the workshops in order to know how many credits to
award. I don’t see that type of information on the website. Do you have a
recommendation for the # of hours for each workshop?

Best,

[NAME]

Hey [NAME]


Each workshop's time varies, but typically a single workshop can be completed within a week if you dedicate 2-3 hours per day.

With 6 workshops in the Professional tier, you can expect to finish within 6-8 weeks. This is a rough estimate though and time for completion is subjective depending on the individual's pace.

Hi, I am looking to take the Testing Accessibility training with learning and development funds from my organization. The organization requires the training to provide an Address, Telephone Number, and number of hours for the training. Would you be able to provide that so I can get it approved?

Hello -
I am with Bright Horizons and we manage the tuition assistance program for Booz Allen Hamilton employees. I have an employee who has submitted for the Epic React Pro for $599. The question I have, I see that the partici[pants do receive completion for the 8 Interactive Self-paced workshops. What I wanted to ask is, do the workshops have any time restrictions as to when they need to be completed? Could it take a participant over a year? And for the "yours forever" part, is that the additional components that are listed including the Bonus Interviews?

We are trying to assist the employee how to properly submitting their application and want to be sure we have all of the information to assist them.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Hey [NAME],


The Epic React Pro course is designed to be (once purchased) completed however the user sees fit - So the workshops do not have any time restrictions for when they need to be completed and the user can access the course whenever they would like for however long they need it which makes it yours forever. 


Please let me know if you have any further questions!

Congrats for releasing this course!

My employer has a system for sponsoring such courses. It is required however to
say how long I will need to finish this course. This is a self paced one. But
how many hours on average are needed to finish this course?

After finishing this course, I have to send in the certificate.

Carl Assmann

FYI: I’m in German military currently and they have a program to support
soldiers getting fit for the time after servance. Might be relevant for your
target audience :)

Your guess is as good as mine. The factors involved are largely dependent on your skill level and interest. 


Let's say 20 hours.

Hi,

Will there be any credit or degree provided after the course completion?
because it is required for me to reimburse the course fee from my company.

Thanks
