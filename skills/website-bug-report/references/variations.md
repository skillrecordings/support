## Example 1 (cnv_1jb388o5)
**Question:**
```
I recently purchased the workshop and it said I would receive a copy of the Crash Course, but I can't access all the videos. Is there another step I need to take?
```

**Answer:**
```
You shouldn’t need any extra steps. It sounds like the bonus access didn’t attach correctly.

Please share your purchase email and I’ll link the Crash Course to your account.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1jcs0acl)
**Question:**
```
I have an issue logging in: I used iPhone email forwarding and now I don’t see the course when I log in. Can you fix the email on the invoice/account?
```

**Answer:**
```
Yes — we can correct the login email to the one you want.

Please share the forwarded email and your preferred email, and I’ll update it.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jcu9axx)
**Question:**
```
I was part of the cohort but I’m not able to access the self‑paced workshop. Could I please get access?
```

**Answer:**
```
Absolutely — I’ll check your cohort access and get you in.

Send the email on the account and I’ll update your permissions.
```
