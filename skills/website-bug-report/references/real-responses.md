Hey [NAME]!

Clicked on your article, and saw some weird css stuff going on in safari. The top banner is being cut off!
Screenshot attached.

Thanks for the great articles.

**Question**

```text
On android, on the landing page for Total Typescript, in the "team seats"
field, I can't delete the default "1", trying to enter "2". Also, I can use
decimal fractions for the number of people and it gives me a corresponding
fractional price.

## cnv_o6evmbr

**Question**

```text
Hi,

I noticed that when inside a tutorials route, if I try to open the top nav user
dropdown menu, the dropdown does not show.

From what I can see, it uses the Radix UI Dropdown Menu component but seems to
be missing <DropdownMenu.Portal> component around the content which would fix
this issue.

Another issue I just found is within the “Tell us what you think!“ modal/dialog.
If I resize the browser window vertically to be smaller than the modal/dialog,
both “Emotion“, “Category“, and “Send feedback“ elements start to overflow the
modal/dialog container.

Let me know if you have any follow-up questions.

I look forward to seeing these issues fixed for everyone to have the best
experience possible!

Thanks.
```

```text
Hi, thanks for letting us know! I just deployed a fix for both issues.

## cnv_9rk59dz

**Question**

```text
Tried to send some feedback, but the form seem to be broken. First of all it keeps closing itself, and if you do get to the point of managing to entering anything and clicking the Send-button, nothing seem to happen.

Looking in the console, there seem to be a combination of some resource failing to load, and a CORS issue preventing the POST request to work? 🤔
