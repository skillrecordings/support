# Edge Cases

## Example 1 (cnv_1j9ysi05)
**Question:**
```
I’ve been getting application errors in the last couple of days. It happens when I go to the next lesson.
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for reporting this — we’ll investigate.

Please share the course name, lesson, browser/device, and a screenshot of the error so we can reproduce it.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1jbibjz9)
**Question:**
```
I purchased Epic Web Dev and should have access to Epic React and Testing JavaScript. When I tried to redeem them they disappeared. Can we troubleshoot?
```

**Answer:**
```
Yes — that’s not expected for a bundle.

Send the purchase email and I’ll re‑attach the bundled products and confirm access.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jbt06n9)
**Question:**
```
I don’t have full access to the Crash Course content beyond the first two free parts. I transferred my account email after registering. Could that be the issue?
```

**Answer:**
```
It could be related to the transfer. I’ll check your account status.

Please share both emails (original + current), and I’ll fix the access flags.
```
