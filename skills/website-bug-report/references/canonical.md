## Example 1 (cnv_1jbxsjz9)
**Question:**
```
I think I purchased the course, but I got an error message: “Processing Issue Detected.” When I log in, I don't see my course available. Can you assist?
```

**Answer:**
```
Sorry about that — I’ll check whether the purchase completed successfully.

Please share the email used at checkout and the time of purchase so I can verify and fix access.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1jc1s2w5)
**Question:**
```
I purchased the workshop, but the videos in the local workshop app are not loading and appear to be behind a paywall. I can access the workshop on the website. Please help.
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for the details — that sounds like an app access issue.

Share your purchase email and the course URL, and I’ll investigate and get the app access restored.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jc5pnxh)
**Question:**
```
When my device hits the workshop intro URL it returns 403 Forbidden. Any ideas?
```

**Answer:**
```
A 403 usually means the access check failed. I’ll look into it.

Please send the email on the account and the exact URL that’s failing.
```
