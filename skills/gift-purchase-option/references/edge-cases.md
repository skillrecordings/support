# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
I already bought the course for myself. Can I switch it to be a gift instead?
```

**Agent:**
```
We can transfer access to another email. Please share the purchase email and the recipient email, and we will update it.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
Can you send a printable gift card or code?
```

**Agent:**
```
We do not currently offer gift cards or codes. The easiest path is to purchase and then we can transfer access to the recipient email.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
My company wants to buy a gift for multiple people. Can you split it?
```

**Agent:**
```
We can help with multiple purchases. Share the list of recipient emails and the product you want, and we will advise the best option.
```
