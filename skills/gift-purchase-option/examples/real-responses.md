Good Afternoon,

I'm launching a new business and I'm planning to do a couple of giveaways
on LinkedIn.

Is there a way that I could purchase a license and gift it to someone?

Very respectfully,

Hey Sam,


Whatever email you purchase under will have access to the course. However, the email you purchase under can always be transferred to a different email by asking us.


Let me know If you have any more questions.

Hello team,

Hope you are doing well!

I wanted to inquire about the course '*Just JavaScript'*.

I'm looking to purchase the course on behalf of someone else and I was
wondering if there was a process for doing that (e.g. via gifting).

Waiting to hear from you soon.

Many thanks,

You can purchase the course for someone else by entering their email address during checkout. They'll receive an email confirming they own the course with instructions to log in.

Hey Larissa,


Thanks for your interest in the course!


Yes - you'll need to enter the email address of the person that you're buying the course for during the check out process. The email address used to purchase the course will be the one that gets attached to the license, and is the one that will need to be used to log in.


Let me know if you have any additional questions!

You've got access to a single course via your separate emails. We can remove one or the other if that is more convenient for you.
