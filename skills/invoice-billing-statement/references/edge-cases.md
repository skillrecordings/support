# Edge Cases

## Example 1 (cnv_1jazjfol)
**Question:**
```
My company has strict invoicing requirements (company name on invoice, 30‑day terms, legal invoice format). Can these requirements be met?
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for outlining the requirements. We can support company‑name invoices, and I can confirm the standard invoice terms we can offer.

Please send the exact billing details and any required legal language so we can verify compliance.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1jamsxwl)
**Question:**
```
I want to buy a course but need to add company info on the invoice. The FAQ says I can customize it, but I don’t see any textbox at checkout. Is it the next step?
```

**Answer:**
```
Good question. The invoice details are applied after purchase — we can update them for you.

Share the company details you need on the invoice and I’ll add them once you complete checkout.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jbd32zp)
**Question:**
```
My employer will reimburse only if the invoice recipient is the company, not my name or email. Can you update the invoice accordingly?
```

**Answer:**
```
Yes — we can update the invoice recipient to the company only.

Please provide the exact company name and address, plus the invoice ID.
```
