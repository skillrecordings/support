# Canonical Examples

## Example 1 (cnv_1j9zr23p)
**Question:**
```
I would like to purchase the course, but I can’t figure out how to enter my VAT so it will be visible on the invoice.
```

**Answer:**
```
We can add VAT/company details to your invoice.

If you already purchased, send the invoice ID and VAT info and I’ll update it. If you haven’t purchased yet, share the details you need on the invoice and I’ll confirm the process.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1ja4vlk5)
**Question:**
```
I need the invoice issued to my company so I can reclaim VAT. If I buy the PRO package, can you issue an invoice to these details?
```

**Answer:**
```
Yes — we can issue a company invoice with VAT details.

Please confirm the legal company name, VAT number, billing address, and the purchase email, and I’ll make sure the invoice reflects that.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jabhtlx)
**Question:**
```
I purchased with my personal email, but my company needs the invoice to show my company email. Can you regenerate the invoice with the new details?
```

**Answer:**
```
Absolutely. We can update the invoice without changing your access email.

Please send the invoice ID and the company email to show on the invoice.
```
