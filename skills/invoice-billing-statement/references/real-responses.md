Hi,

I purchased your course on November 25 and downloaded the Invoice. However,
there is no specification of VAT. I need the full information so that I can
register the course as an expense for my employer. Could you send me the
full information please?

Best regards,
[NAME]

Yes absolutely. It's available on the website. Unfortunately, an outage is causing an email slowdown so so login emails are talking extra time to arrive.
