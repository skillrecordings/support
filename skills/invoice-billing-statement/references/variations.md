## Example 1 (cnv_1jamlp2d)
**Question:**
```
I’m planning to purchase and would like a corporate invoice. Could you share the required details or process for issuing a business invoice?
```

**Answer:**
```
Happy to help. We can issue a corporate invoice after purchase.

Send the legal company name, tax/VAT ID, billing address, and the purchase email, and I’ll ensure the invoice includes them.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_1japg9k5)
**Question:**
```
The FAQ says I can add VAT/company details, but I can’t see any input for the data. How does it work?
```

**Answer:**
```
Those details are added after purchase. We can update the invoice for you.

Just send the VAT/company info and the invoice ID once you complete checkout.
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jb7m3tx)

I need an invoice with my employer’s details for reimbursement. Do I need to purchase first or can you add those details before?

You can purchase first, then we’ll update the invoice with employer details.

Share the company info and the purchase email and I’ll take care of it.
```
