Subject: 11 Tips For Coding With Ralph Wiggum


Hey [NAME],

What if you could point an AI at your codebase and have it ship features for hours while you're completely away from the keyboard?

That's Ralph. It's taking Twitter by storm. An autonomous coding loop that lets AI agents work through your project unsupervised. You define what needs to be built. Ralph figures out how and keeps iterating until it's finished.

But Ralph isn't magic. It's a pattern with real tradeoffs.

In this article, I'm breaking down 11 tips for making Ralph actually work, from defining scope so it knows when to stop, to using Docker sandboxes for safety, to setting up feedback loops that keep code quality high.

You'll learn the difference between HITL and AFK modes, why small steps matter, and how to prioritize risky tasks first.

Hey! I found it difficult to find the modules of v1, but once I did, there are
these things called Explainers, which are new to me. Anyway, they all take me to
a 404 unfortunately, so there might be something wonky going on.
```

**Answer**

```text
Hi, 


Thanks for the heads up. The explainers are outdated now and direct to a url that doesn't exist. 


Let me know If you have anymore questions!
