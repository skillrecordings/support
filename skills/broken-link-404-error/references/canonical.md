## Example 1 (cnv_1jbtuuxx)
**Question:**

Hello, the email login link isn’t logging me in. I get a 404 page.
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for reporting this — the login link should not 404.

Please share the email address you used and I’ll send a fresh login link and investigate the broken one.
```

## Example 2 (cnv_96wavwn)
**Question:**
```
I’m getting a route not found when I click the Testing React Components section. The URL returns a 404.
```

**Answer:**
```
Sorry about that — I’ll get the broken route fixed.

Can you send the exact URL that 404s and the course name so I can patch it quickly?
```

## Example 3 (cnv_1jcmgajp)
**Question:**
```
The Start Learning link is broken. The page shows then we’re redirected. It only works if we go through Categories.
```

**Answer:**
```
Thanks for the clear repro steps — that’s very helpful.

I’ll check the Start Learning URL and fix the redirect. In the meantime, using Categories is the right workaround.
```
