Hi Matt!

I've been following your journey for a while, and purchased the full TS course!
I've also been to your in person workshops for TS!

I'm a C# dev and new to TS and have got a new TS dev role. I'm wanting to get
ahead as fast as I can, do you have a TS roadmap on what to be learning as a TS
dev and beyond? I'm interested in all the AI videos you're making at the moment!
Keep up the great work!

Many thanks,

Aaron

Hi,

I have purchased your TypeScript Core Volume (PPP) package. However, I am unable to understand where to begin learning about TypeScript.

I am a JavaScript developer and have a reasonably basic understanding of the language concepts and some of the ES6 improvements. I would like to begin my journey of TypeScript and gain mastery of it and use it to implement my projects.

I would like to seek your kind help in understanding where do I start on Total TypeScript, is it from the Free Tutorials or from Pro Workshops. If its Free Tutorials, please suggest a starting point.

Hello,

My team just purchased the course and we noticed the ordering of the
modules is changing. Earlier this week, "Fundamentals of Testing in
JavaScript" was the first module and now it appears in the middle. Can you
tell me in what order we should go through these modules?

Thanks,

I think it would improve the experience if you suggested a learning path. I.e.
what course to start with. Should I start with transformations or generics or?
Maybe it doesnt matter but having a sense of path would help I think.

Really really awesome platform btw, thank you so much for providing this!

Hi there! I think the courses are awesome!! I have a question I cannot find an
answer to (checked the FAQ and Discord): I there any particular recommended
order for the pro workshops when you come from the free ones? Should I do Type
Transformations first or the generics or the advanced patterns? Or don’t they
build upon each other? Thank you for your answer :heart:

**Question**

Dear Total TypeScript team,

I purchased your TypeScript Pro Complete package and I’m a total beginner
in TypeScript. I’m planning to complete all of the workshops, including the
free ones, and I was wondering if there is a recommended order in which to
take them.

I understand that some workshops list explicit prerequisites, but many do
not. For example, would it make sense to start with all of the free
workshops first and then continue with the workshops included in the Pro
Complete package in order?

It would be very helpful to know:

   - A suggested learning sequence for someone starting from scratch
   - Which workshops cover overlapping material, if any


Thanks in advance for your guidance. I’m really looking forward to working
through the content.

Kinds regards,
Rebecca Tang

Hello,

I need to learn next.js for work but first need to learn react, will
your course be overkill if my end goal is next.js 15 with react 19?

Thanks
