# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
I only have weekends to study. Which path is most time-efficient?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for sharing. Tell me how many hours per week you can commit and your goals, and I will recommend the most efficient path.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
I want to switch careers into frontend. Should I start with this course or another one?

Career switches usually benefit from a strong foundation. If you share your current experience, I can suggest a beginner-friendly path before this course.

I have already learned [TECH] but want to focus on testing. What should I do?

Great focus area. Tell me your current level with testing and I will suggest the best sequence of lessons or workshops.
