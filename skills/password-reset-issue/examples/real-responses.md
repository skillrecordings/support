Hey [NAME],


I apologize for the delayed response! There was a bug recently introduced that was causing the erroneous prompt for you to set a recovery password. This has been reverted, so you should be able to request a login link that works now. Let me know if that's not the case.


You can purchase another license with the 40% off discount using this link.


Let me know if you have any additional questions!

Dear Just Javascript team,

I have recently changed my phone number and unfortunately forgot the
password for the email associated with my Just JavaScript account. As
a result, I am unable to log in, and my account was automatically
logged out after 60 days.
I have successfully completed all 9 episodes and quizzes in the
course, and only the final episode (Episode 10) remains for me to
complete.

In light of this, I kindly request that you update my account with the
email address from which I am sending this message. I would greatly
appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter so I can continue
my learning and complete the course.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
[NAME] Hasanova

Hey [NAME], 


What email address is associated with this account?


And for security reasons could you provide the last 4 digits of the card that you used to purchase the license?

I was able to access the admin console this time, but I'd previously
already enabled 2sv, so I'm not sure what else I should do there.

Hello.

I’m wondering if it is possible for you to resend the link to log into the course again? I’ve managed to lose my login details & I can’t find the confirmation email from when I first purchased the course.

I’ve forgotten which email I used so I’ unable to use the form to resend the email from your page. 

I do have my invoice number which is: EGG-KCD-TESTING-87803

Kind regards Marius

Hi [NAME]!

So, I have switched computers and have had this link expire on me. Is there
anyway that I can grab another link from you so I can access this content?

Hi,

Each time I click the signin link from your emails, I am sent to a password reset page. Resetting the password then errors with:

Your password could not be reset. Reset password token is invalid

Can you help solve this?

Thanks

Hey [NAME],


Thanks for the feedback and giving the course a go – per your request we've refunded your course enrollment and revoked access.


It may take 5-10 business days for the refunded amount to show up in your account, depending on how quickly it's processed by your financial institution.

Hey [NAME],


We don't have a username and password authentication system for Testing JavaScript.


You can access your purchase by using the email login link at the top of https://testingjavascript.com. You'll need to enter the email address you used to purchase the workshop ([EMAIL]) to have a login link sent.


Once you're logged in, you can view a fully customized invoice here: https://testingjavascript.com/invoice.
