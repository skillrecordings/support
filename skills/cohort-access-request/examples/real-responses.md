Hi,

I was ill the last few days and wanted to catch up today, but I cannot access any of the cohort lessons.
The mail account I’ve used to purchase a ticket is [EMAIL] <mailto:[EMAIL]>. It also shows a banner
which says I have purchased a ticket. Is there anything I need to do to access it, or is it buggy?
The “you have access" email also links to a 404 page.

Thanks in advance,
Henning

Hey there,


Sorry about that, there was something going on with the UI.


Everything should be back up and running smoothly now. Please let me know if you continue with issues. 


Thanks for the patience, happy learning!

There is! Once you've connected your EpicAI.pro account to discord (https://www.epicai.pro/profile), it will give you access to the discord channels.


See you in there!

Hello,

I have a problem with access to the workshop content.
I can only watch the first lesson. I'm logged in, but the rest of the
workshop content is locked.

I appreciate your help,

Hi,

My email is [EMAIL]

I was part of the epic ai cohort back in the fall. I am not able to access
the self paced workshop, which I believe is an error based on what [NAME]
said in the discord. Could I please get access to this? It is new years
eve, don't worry I am not expecting this to be fixed today at all. Just
when you get a chance in the next week or so.

Thank you,

[NAME] Hansen.

You should have access to all the self paced content now! Let me know If not.

Hi Epic AI team,
sorry to interrupt your day but, as for the subject, I confirmed on Discord with [NAME] that I have some issues in accessing both the specific Epic AI channel under Workshops as well as the workshop itself in epicai.pro. Are you able to help me out?

I attach my invoice for the cohort in case you need proof of my purchase.

Thank you so much in advance.

Have a great day,
Andrea

Hi there,

I registered for the upcoming cohort starting on December 8th - shortly
after registration I got this email with a link that should allow me access
to the content of the first day of the program (see attached screenshot).
However, clicking on this link takes me to a page in which all of the
content is locked - even after logging in and nothing really works on this
page. Is this a malfunction or maybe I am missing something?

I would appreciate your help with this.

Sorry, the email is an automation gone bad. Only the Crash Course is available.

Hey there,

My workplace has enrolled me in the Master the Model Context Protocol course however they did not give me the link until today, but the course started yesterday. Is there a way you can provide the access link so I can start catching up.

Many thanks,

Hey [NAME], you should definitely have no trouble catching up. Just make sure to join the Discord and take a look at the conversation history. And you can watch the recordings of the office hours. Everything else is pretty self-paced. Welcome to the cohort!

Hi! I was wondering if the upcoming workshop will be recorded. I’d like to
review the material afterwards in case I miss anything or want to revisit

We won't have any recordings, but we will have a written summary.

Hey,

I am interested in the Epic React Masterclass which I received an email
about this morning - though I am curious to know if the workshops will be
recorded and if we will have access to the recordings afterwards?

Thanks,

[NAME] Jones
```

**Answer**

```text
Hi [NAME],


The material will be recorded in a very high value-to-minute format on EpicReact.Dev similar to TestingJavaScript.com and you can buy a license for that when it's released. If you get a Masterclass ticket then you'll not only get a free license to EpicReact.Dev, but you'll get early access as well.


No recording of the workshop itself will be available, but you'll find that EpicReact.Dev is much better than a simple workshop recording.
```
