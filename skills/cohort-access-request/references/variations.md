## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
I bought the cohort but the lessons are locked. What do I need to do?
```

**Agent:**
```
I can help with that. Please send the email you used to purchase and I will make sure access is active.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
It says I have a ticket, but the cohort page is still locked for me.
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for the heads up. Share the purchase email (or invoice ID) and I will fix your access.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
I can only see the first lesson in the cohort. The rest are locked.
```

**Agent:**
```
Sorry about that. Please confirm your account email and I will unlock the rest of the cohort content for you.
```
