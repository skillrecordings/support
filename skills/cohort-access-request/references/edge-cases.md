# Edge Cases

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
My company bought the cohort for me, but I never received access. It might be under a different email.
```

**Agent:**
```
Got it. Please share the purchaser email or invoice ID and the email you want access on. I will match the purchase and transfer access.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
I joined Cohort 1 last year and now the self-paced content is locked.
Was access supposed to expire?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for checking in. Access should still be available for past cohorts.

Please confirm the email you used and I will restore access for you.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
The welcome email link says I have access, but the cohort page shows everything locked.
```

**Agent:**
```
Sorry about that. Sometimes the login session gets out of sync.

Please log out, then use the login link at [LOGIN_LINK]. If it still shows locked, send the email you used and I will update access.
```
