# Canonical Examples

## Example 1
**Customer:**
```
Hi there, I purchased the MCP cohort but I cannot access the lessons anymore.
My purchase email is [EMAIL]. Can you help?
```

**Agent:**
```
Thanks for reaching out! I can help with that.

I have re-enabled access for [EMAIL]. Please log out and back in, then visit the cohort page. If you still see anything locked, reply here and I will take another look.
```

## Example 2
**Customer:**
```
I joined Cohort 2 last month and the cohort page says I do not have access.
I can share my invoice if needed.
```

**Agent:**
```
Sorry about that. I can fix it.

Please reply with the email you used at checkout (or the invoice ID), and I will restore access right away.
```

## Example 3
**Customer:**
```
I was sick and fell behind. Now I cannot open any of the cohort content.
Is my access expired?
```

**Agent:**
```
No problem, I can help.

Share the email you purchased with and I will make sure your cohort access is active again. Once it is restored, you can catch up at your own pace.
```
