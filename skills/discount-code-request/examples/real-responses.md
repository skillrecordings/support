The 40% discount window is over but there is about an hour and a half left for the 30% discount. It is still an extremely valuable purchase!

Hey [NAME],

Follow you on X and love your content as well as what you do for the open source community. I am still learning and getting my foot wet to get from sales into the tech playing field after some years of being just unhappy on the job.

Do you by any chance offer discounts? If not that’s totally fine and will revisit your workshops in a couple of months.

Hello [NAME],

Becoming a TypeScript Wizard is a boon for your work, your team, and your employer.

Many workplaces automatically approve training expenses around $500 or less, so the discounted price for Total Typescript might be auto-approved ($556 for Pro Complete or $212 for Pro Essentials).

But if you do need boss approval, and you’re not sure what to put in the request, ​I created this template you can use to tell your boss why it’s a great idea​ for them to invest in Total TypeScript Pro Complete:
   
   - TypeScript helps catch errors before production through compile-time checking, saving development time and improving user experience
   - [NAME]-wide access ensures shared knowledge of TypeScript best practices, enabling faster development and more confident code updates

Best of all, right now, Total TypeScript is on sale — meaning you (or your boss!) can save $239 on the Complete package, plus additional discounts for your team for 5 or more seats so you can level up as a team.

And if you happen to be a team lead, consider giving them the gift of becoming a Typescript Wizard!

“The course has been a game changer and I’m not even that far through it yet. I really like my colleagues, I just wish they would listen to me and invest in Total Typescript.”

Use the boss letter template to ask for approval today: ​https://www.totaltypescript.com/boss​​

Or ​Enroll now​ and save $239

The discount expires next week on May 22 @ Midnight, though, so don’t miss it.

PS: Total TypeScript Pro Essentials​ (included in Pro Complete) is excellent if you're just getting started and is currently 15% off

Hey [NAME],

I love TypeScript for its community. They're generous, curious, and fiercely inventive.

And, of course, because it's absurdly powerful. TypeScript's type system is https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/8ghqh3ulr5v988ak/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL21pY3Jvc29mdC9UeXBlU2NyaXB0L2lzc3Vlcy8xNDgzMw==. In other words, you can use it to run any algorithm. And a few https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/l2heh6u3xk9rg5f6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1fb05neVVBRXYwUQ== are stretching TypeScript to its limits.

https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/owhkhwurq8voz7bv/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL3R5cGljb2RlL21pc3Rjc3M= is a bonkers take on creating custom components in TypeScript apps. It does something I've never seen before - generating TypeScript code from CSS.

You write some CSS, with some data-* attributes specified:

button {
  &[data-variant="primary"] {
    background-color: black;
  }

  &[data-variant="secondary"] {
    background-color: grey;
  }
}


Then, you can write some JSX, with a data-variant property - and the data-variant is strongly typed:

<>
  <button data-variant="primary">Save</button>
  <button data-variant="secondary">Save</button>

  <button data-variant="tertiary">Save</button>
  {/*                   ^^^^^^^^ Error! */}
</>


It works by generating some types in the https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/x0hph3uwq763gwc5/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG90YWx0eXBlc2NyaXB0LmNvbS9ib29rcy90b3RhbC10eXBlc2NyaXB0LWVzc2VudGlhbHMvbW9kdWxlcy1zY3JpcHRzLWFuZC1kZWNsYXJhdGlvbi1maWxlcw== which influences the https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/kkhmh2ulx9qm76ul/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG90YWx0eXBlc2NyaXB0LmNvbS93aGF0LWlzLWpzeC1pbnRyaW5zaWNlbGVtZW50cw== available:

declare namespace JSX {
  interface IntrinsicElements {
    button: CustomButtonProps; // MistCSS-generated type
  }
}


So you write some CSS, and you get a strongly-typed component out of it. I think I'll be sticking to https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/25h2h9u2mozd5nh3/aHR0cHM6Ly90YWlsd2luZGNzcy5jb20v - but the idea is fascinating.

Next up is gql.tada. GraphQL and TypeScript typically have a fraught relationship. You query GraphQL endpoints with strings:

const query = `
  query {
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;

const result = await fetchFromGraphQLEndpoint(query);
//    ^ How do type this?


result here can't usually be strongly typed. You can't know that it's returning a user object with an id and a name.

It's common to patch over this with https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/9qhzhdup52m97wu9/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGUtZ3VpbGQuZGV2L2dyYXBocWwvY29kZWdlbg==, which works https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/48hvh7urx2egodfx/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj01d2VGeU1vQkdONA==.

But https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/vqh3hmupwk7g55hg/aHR0cHM6Ly9ncWwtdGFkYS4wbm8uY28vZ2V0LXN0YXJ0ZWQv takes a different approach. They have written a GraphQL string parser in TypeScript. You wrap your queries in a function call, and boom:

import { graphql } from "gql.tada";

const query = graphql(`
  query {
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`);

const result = await fetchFromGraphQLEndpoint(query);
//    ^ Typed as { id: string; name: string }


How is it doing this? The magic of https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/l2heh6u3xk9w55h6/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG90YWx0eXBlc2NyaXB0LmNvbS9ib29rcy90b3RhbC10eXBlc2NyaXB0LWVzc2VudGlhbHMvZGVzaWduaW5nLXlvdXItdHlwZXMtaW4tdHlwZXNjcmlwdCN0ZW1wbGF0ZS1saXRlcmFsLXR5cGVzLWluLXR5cGVzY3JpcHQ=. TypeScript's type system is reading the string passed in, and inferring the type of the result.

It's incredible, and surprisingly fast. If I were starting a GraphQL project today, this is how I'd query it.

The last is the maddest. https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/m2h7h6u84npwkgim/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS96YWNrX292ZXJmbG93 built https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/e0hph0u0rng59es8/aHR0cHM6Ly96YWNrb3ZlcmZsb3cuZGV2L3dyaXRpbmcvZmxhcHB5LWJpcmQtaW4tdHlwZS1sZXZlbC10eXBlc2NyaXB0Lw==.


Yes, you can https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/z2hgh7u3ldv09dsp/aHR0cHM6Ly90eXZtLjEwMHguc29mdHdhcmUv. And yes, it's written only in TypeScript types.

He got this working by creating a custom type-level TypeScript runtime, written in https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/kkhmh2ulx9q4g6al/aHR0cHM6Ly96aWdsYW5nLm9yZy8=, that can run TypeScript types as if they were runtime code.

The code to draw the pipes? A https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/25h2h9u2moznrna3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG90YWx0eXBlc2NyaXB0LmNvbS9ib29rcy90b3RhbC10eXBlc2NyaXB0LWVzc2VudGlhbHMvZGVzaWduaW5nLXlvdXItdHlwZXMtaW4tdHlwZXNjcmlwdCNnZW5lcmljLXR5cGVz. The code to check collisions? A generic type. Every piece of runtime code you'd usually capture in a function is now a type.

Is it wise to write Flappy Bird in the type system? No. But the fact it's possible is mind-expanding.

To put it mildly, TypeScript's type system has very few limits. You can tweak global types for better autocomplete. You can solve old problems in new ways.

You can even use the type system to drive a freaking game engine. 🤯

I highly recommend checking out the code for these projects.

It's a wild ride, and they're full of useful ideas you can study and repurpose for your own projects. If you're feeling brave, reverse-engineering is a great way to learn.

The other great way to learn this is by doing. https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/qdumrxpdvns7h7xogqnslh8lgxkkkb4/qvh8h8urk65qgetl/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG90YWx0eXBlc2NyaXB0LmNvbS8=, my TypeScript masterclass, is all about action. With over 400 carefully crafted coding challenges, on every topic from the basics of objects, functions and narrowing to advanced magic like generics, type transformations and advanced patterns Total TypeScript gives you a complete learning path to become the TypeScript wizard at your company.

Every challenge is designed to be just hard enough to be fun and exciting, and narrow enough in scope to be done quickly. You can knock out a couple before a meeting or on your lunch break.

Hi,

I am fairly early in my journey with learning Reactjs and I have recently
been recommended this course.

I really would like to buy the Pro tier because learn testing react apps,
however it is sadly very expensive for me.

Could I please have a discount code? I would appreciate this greatly please!

Thank you and I look forward to your reply.

Hey [NAME],


Thanks for reaching out!


We aren't currently offering discounts on the course.



However, if you're able to purchase either the Basic or Standard package, you'll have the opportunity to upgrade to the Pro package later on for the difference in pricing between your initial purchase tier and the cost of the Pro package when you upgrade.
