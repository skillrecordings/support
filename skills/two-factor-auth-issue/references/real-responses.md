Hello [NAME],

My name is Hanisha, Im representing the Google Workspace Account Recovery team and I am glad to assist you. I am contacting you on behalf of my colleague Hemangini who is out of office.

I have again submitted a ticket to the internal team to help you with a 2SV code and password reset link. Kindly allow us 24 to 72 business hours or less to get this ticket resolved and send it to you.

Should you have queries in the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me by replying to this message.

Have a lovely day!

I have been able to reset the password but now when accessing the admin
console so that I can set up billing and not have interrupted service, I
encounter this:

There are no options to proceed or hints about how to navigate beyond this
dead end.

Hello,

My workplace purchased the JustJavascript for me through an email address
that I don't always have access to (my boss has access to it, and the two
factor auth goes to his phone).
This is making it super hard for me to actually finish it on the weekends
since the token expires (I assume, every 24 hours).
Is it possible to transfer the course to another email? And if so, what
would you need from us?
Best
[NAME]

This address is not disposable... just really old 🙃

I tried to verify that email and got this error message: "Disposable email address". If you think this is wrong, shoot an email to [EMAIL].

Hi,


Thanks for the heads up!


There was a bug on our side, but everything should be back up and running smoothly now.


Please let Kent ([EMAIL]) know if that's not the case.
