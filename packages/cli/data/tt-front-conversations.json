Despite what some say in the YouTube and X comments I have really appreciated your pivot with AI Hero and the content you have been putting out.

Your recent video about using plan mode extensively and the tips from that have genuinely made a tremendous difference in the way I work. \n\nIt is giving me more trust in what an LLM is putting out because of that initial planning/exchange. In the past I’ve just given a series of prompts and Claude et al have basically ripped through with varying levels of success, so I had been feeling a bit bummed out despite the Opus hype until recently. \n\nThings like this I would love to learn more about!\n\nKind regards,\nTom\n\nOn Thu, 22 Jan 2026, at 9:00 PM, Total TypeScript wrote:\n> Hey Tom,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community \n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/zlu3zg2pw3i7u4knr92aphwokq500b6hkknn5/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v> \n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is \n> pretty new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?

We recently shipped *Open **Claude CoWork\n(*https://github.com/ComposioHQ/open-claude-cowork*)*, an open-source take\non Claude Code. Most existing implementations (including others in OSS) are\nessentially GUI or browser-based wrappers that automate tasks locally or\nrely on browser automation for SaaS apps — which gets slow and brittle.\n\nWhat makes Co-Work different is that it comes *natively integrated with\n800+ APIs* as composio manages the auth on backend. This means users can\nnot only automate desktop tasks, but actually complete real knowledge work\nacross tools like Linear, Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc. fast.\n\nWe’d love to collaborate on a dedicated video where you walk through\nCo-Work and, in the process, explore why deep, API-level integrations\nmatter for agentic workflows.\n\nThe project’s getting strong organic traction already — Julian Goldie and\nTom Doerr have both shared it recently — and momentum is picking up\nquickly. I have attached some example demos of its capabilities. Do you\nthink this will be a fit for your audience?\n\nWould love to do a dedicated video this week.\nBest,\nAudery Graham\nComposio <https://composio.dev/>\n",

This is a community/relationship-building message that should be handled by the Total TypeScript team directly, not through the support system.\nHowever, since this came through support channels, I can note: Thorr appears to be an engaged community member building on Total TypeScript's ideas and would likely be a good fit for deeper community engagement or partnership discussions. This should probably be routed to the business development or community team rather than support.",

It’s perfect for\ndevelopers and QA teams looking to speed up API testing and automate flows\nin CI.\n\nWe’re running a paid promo for creators — happy to discuss rates for a\nsponsored feature or demo.\n\nIf you’re interested, let me know and I’ll send over more details!\n\nThanks,\nMustafa\n",

We’ve previously collaborated with top creators on YouTube and TikTok and are open to new collaborations. \n\n\n\nFormat of cooperation: \n\n• Our main focus is an integration in one of your upcoming YouTube videos (30–90 seconds) \n\n• Other options are also possible: short mentions, full dedicated reviews, or integrations on Instagram or TikTok \n\n• A special promo code providing your audience with 1 month of free access \n\n• We’ll share all necessary materials and links beforehand to make preparation as simple as possible. If this collaboration appeals to you, we’ll send a media kit for further details. \n\n\n\nAgreement details: \n\n• This is a paid partnership — we welcome your pricing and can provide partial prepayment if that’s easier \n\n• Timing is open — we’ll fit your availability \n\n• Your creative freedom is important to us, so the integration will remain organic. \n\n\n\nPlease share your usual rates or media kit when convenient. After that, we’ll prepare the paperwork and campaign materials. \n\nIf you prefer, we can set up a quick Zoom call (10–15 minutes) to cover the details. \n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---- On Thu, 09 Oct 2025 05:39:21 +0300 Haze Provinsal <team@totaltypescript.com> wrote ---\n\n\n\nHey mailto:courtney@adsmanager.tech ,\n\n\n\nWe support any questions related to the course and platform functionality, but you can reach out to Matt directly on X/bluesky/discord for this kind of collaboration.\n\n\n\nhttps://x.com/mattpocockuk  \n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/mattpocock.com  \n\nhttps://www.mattpocock.com/  \n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n—\n\nHaze\n\n\n\n\nOn October 6, 2025 at 6:35 AM PDT mailto:jparedes4@utmachala.edu.ec  wrote:\n\nGreetings\n\nMy name is Courtney, and I am an advertising manager.

Here are some questions to ask yourself:\n\n  *   Does it feel like you’re using TypeScript with gloves on — never quite grasping it with the finesse you’d like?\n  *   Like you’re working against TypeScript, instead of fully seizing its promise of faster, cleaner code with fewer bugs and headaches?\n  *   Do you find yourself wondering what new and obscure errors mean?\n  *   Do you feel in total control with any, infer, satisfies, never, unknown and other advanced tools?\n  *   Have you mastered generics for creating code that’s flexible, reusable, and DRY? How about transformations?\n  *   Are you ready to become completely confident in your abilities in 2026 — not just to know what to do, and when, but to solve problems that arise from AI assistants?\n  *   And would you learn more, faster, and better (and have more fun) with a code-first learning experience and an expert guide (yours truly)?\n\nIf you’ve answered “yes” to these questions, then Total TypeScript Complete is a great choice!\n\nYou’ll get instant access to 400+ coding challenges in 5 comprehensive workshops from beginner to extremely advanced when you enroll.\n\nAnd remember: while I’ve laid out a 26-week path to take you from total TS beginner to Wizard, you can start anywhere — at your own level of experience — and you can go at your own pace.

      "body": "Hello, this is Tia from the Proactor AI team. We’ve previously discussed a\npotential collaboration.\n\nDuring the third round of creator outreach, we noticed that our budget was\ntoo low, which affected creators’ willingness to work with us. After\ninternal discussions, we have increased our collaboration budget and\nofficially launched the fourth phase of our global promotion plan.\n\nIn the testing phase, we developed a high-conversion video script that\nhelped a creator achieve over 1 million views and 5,000+ new user\nregistrations with a single video. We are now inviting experienced creators\nto replicate this success.\n\nYou will receive the full script and asset package, and each video only\ntakes about 10 minutes to produce.\nReference video: TikTok example\n<https://proactor-ai.jmailroute.net/x/d?c=49121671&l=2525ae92-5e6b-48cd-a047-68f7a007aca0&r=1cb23678-d14e-40b8-9861-52a64017e7f6>\n\n*Collaboration Details:*\n\n   1.\n\n   Create a new account dedicated to our brand (this ensures your main\n   account’s content style remains unaffected).\n   2.\n\n   Recreate videos based on the script and materials provided, posting 5\n   videos per week for long-term collaboration.\n   3.\n\n   *$300 per video*, settled weekly (*$1,500 per week*).\n   4.\n\n   Monthly performance bonuses will be granted based on account growth. Rates\n   are negotiable—I am happy to help outstanding creators apply for higher\n   commissions.\n\nIf you’re available and interested this week, I can immediately send the\nupdated collaboration plan.\nWe look forward to working together again and creating the next viral hit!\n\nAdditionally, for identity verification, you may confirm through Proactor\nAI’s official email: *support@proactor.ai <support@proactor.ai>*.\nBest regards,\nTia\ncontact me via WhatsApp: +44 7421840005.\n",

We’ve previously discussed a\npotential collaboration.\n\nDuring the third round of creator outreach, we noticed that our budget was\ntoo low, which affected creators’ willingness to work with us. After\ninternal discussions, we have increased our collaboration budget and\nofficially launched the fourth phase of our global promotion plan.\n\nIn the testing phase, we developed a high-conversion video script that\nhelped a creator achieve over 1 million views and 5,000+ new user\nregistrations with a single video. We are now inviting experienced creators\nto replicate this success.\n\nYou will receive the full script and asset package, and each video only\ntakes about 10 minutes to produce.\nReference video: TikTok example\n<https://proactor-ai.jmailroute.net/x/d?c=49121671&l=2525ae92-5e6b-48cd-a047-68f7a007aca0&r=1cb23678-d14e-40b8-9861-52a64017e7f6>\n\n*Collaboration Details:*\n\n   1.\n\n   Create a new account dedicated to our brand (this ensures your main\n   account’s content style remains unaffected).\n   2.\n\n   Recreate videos based on the script and materials provided, posting 5\n   videos per week for long-term collaboration.\n   3.\n\n   *$300 per video*, settled weekly (*$1,500 per week*).\n   4.\n\n   Monthly performance bonuses will be granted based on account growth.
