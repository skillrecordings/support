      "body": "Hi Matt/AI Hero team,\n\nExcited for the course! I have a few questions below so that I'm best prepared:\n\n> What you need to bring Technical requirements:\n>\n> - GitHub account with a repo you can work on\n\nDoes this repo need to be public, or can it be private work-related?\nBetter if my repo is full-stack, front-end, or back-end?\nAny other guidance on the repo (which programming language, webapp or mobile app, etc.) for the smoothest 4 hours? I have flexibility and am asking because I'll be creating the repo for the course.\n\n> - Any one of these AI coding CLIs installed and working:\n>\n> - Claude Code (Opus 4.5)\n> - OpenCode\n> - Copilot CLI\n> - Codex (GPT 5.2)\n\nDo you always stick with a specific agent while Ralphing? With my legacy pre-Ralph HITL Cursor AI ways, I would find even the smartest agents (Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2) can struggle or hit a dead-end while the other smart agent can sometimes quickly solve, so at times I flip agents. Perhaps you never encountered this, or perhaps those clear PRDs of yours make the problem far less or non-existant.\n\nThanks!\nJon\n\nOn Thursday, January 22nd, 2026 at 11:09 AM, AI Hero <team@aihero.dev> wrote:\n\n> You're In!

I have a few questions below so that I'm best prepared:\n\n> What you need to bring Technical requirements:\n>\n> - GitHub account with a repo you can work on\n\nDoes this repo need to be public, or can it be private work-related?\nBetter if my repo is full-stack, front-end, or back-end?\nAny other guidance on the repo (which programming language, webapp or mobile app, etc.) for the smoothest 4 hours? I have flexibility and am asking because I'll be creating the repo for the course.\n\n> - Any one of these AI coding CLIs installed and working:\n>\n> - Claude Code (Opus 4.5)\n> - OpenCode\n> - Copilot CLI\n> - Codex (GPT 5.2)\n\nDo you always stick with a specific agent while Ralphing? With my legacy pre-Ralph HITL Cursor AI ways, I would find even the smartest agents (Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2) can struggle or hit a dead-end while the other smart agent can sometimes quickly solve, so at times I flip agents. Perhaps you never encountered this, or perhaps those clear PRDs of yours make the problem far less or non-existant.\n\nThanks!\nJon\n\nOn Thursday, January 22nd, 2026 at 11:09 AM, AI Hero <team@aihero.dev> wrote:\n\n> You're In!
