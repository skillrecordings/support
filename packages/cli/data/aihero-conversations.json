I started with\nLovable and have since moved on to using OpenCode (best) and Cursor\n(Antigravity is too flaky). I’ve been able to build extremely useful tools\nand websites for my small family business, and with the integration of\nGitHub and Vercel, the deployment process essentially takes care of itself.\n\nI’m interested in staying current with these self-work tools, but I'm also\nfascinated by what this means for the profession of software development.\nAs a product leader, my job spans business & vision vision, through\nideation, and to prod.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

They're stateful sandbox environments that you can easily checkpoint and restore. Thomas says they're \"ball-point disposable computers,\" ( https://fly.io/blog/design-and-implementation/?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) but whatever you call them, they're probably worth checking out if you're sick of trying to build or test anything in ephemeral sandboxes.\n\nYou only pay for the resources you actually consume while running them, but you can kick the tires now with $30 of free credit. Let us know what you build!\n\nProduct updates\n\nThe Fresh Produce ( https://community.fly.io/c/fresh-produce/27?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) section of our Community Forum is where we update y'all on what's new. There's a lot over there about Sprites, but there's some other important stuff going on, too:\n\n* Postgres 17 is here ( https://community.fly.io/t/you-asked-and-we-shipped-postgres-17-on-mpg/26430?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )! (For people who like shiny new indexes, planner improvements, and general \"Postgres got faster again\" vibes.)\n* The experience of launching an app from the dashboard got a makeover! ( https://community.fly.io/t/launch-your-app-from-the-dashboard-better-ui-heck-yeah/26838?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )\n\nInside Flyball\n\nWe're excited be able to share Sprites with you, and we're honestly having fun using them ourselves.

They're stateful sandbox environments that you can easily checkpoint and restore. Thomas says they're \"ball-point disposable computers,\" ( https://fly.io/blog/design-and-implementation/?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) but whatever you call them, they're probably worth checking out if you're sick of trying to build or test anything in ephemeral sandboxes.\n\nYou only pay for the resources you actually consume while running them, but you can kick the tires now with $30 of free credit. Let us know what you build!\n\nProduct updates\n\nThe Fresh Produce ( https://community.fly.io/c/fresh-produce/27?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io ) section of our Community Forum is where we update y'all on what's new. There's a lot over there about Sprites, but there's some other important stuff going on, too:\n\n* Postgres 17 is here ( https://community.fly.io/t/you-asked-and-we-shipped-postgres-17-on-mpg/26430?utm_campaign=Jan+%2725+Newsletter&utm_content=Email&utm_medium=email_action&utm_source=customer.io )! (For people who like shiny new indexes, planner improvements, and general \"Postgres got faster again\" vibes.)\n* The experience of launching an app from the dashboard got a makeover!

      "body": "Okay got it!\n\nFirst, great news about the workshop sales selling out 🙌 that is great\nsignal.\n\nGiven this, and of course your own motivation being a huge piece of the\nsuccess, here's what we're thinking for the big picture year long plan at a\nvery high level:\n\n*Each quarter is punctuated by a cohort and we work backwards from that. *\n\nWithin each quarter, you'll have a combination of components:\n\n   - *A smaller product launch. *Think something on par with the half day\n   workshop or AI-SDK Crash Course)that provides both revenue AND\n   assets/insights that carry forward and compound\n   - *At least one new FREEBIE launch, aimed at the top of funnel. *This\n   would tie into your Twitter/Youtube activity and be designed to get people\n   from those platforms to the list\n   - *At least one cohort. *I say at least one, because this could *also* turn\n   into a rhythm where on month 1 of a quarter you re-run a past cohort, and\n   month 3 you launch a new one. This exact rhythm could vary, but the goal\n   would be to blend the leverage of cohorts that people missed the first time\n   AND introducing new things that you're excited about.\n\nIn the case of Q1 (now), since it's almost the end of Jan already and this\ncohort is effectively your small product launch in Feb, I don't think we\nwill be able to fit a re-run in but we can absolutely plan for it at the\ntop of Q2.\n\nWe'd map this out on a calendar to make sure it's clear and the overlapping\ntimelines make sense, but wanted to share this first for an initial gut\ncheck.\n\nHow's that land for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Alex\n\n📙  my book: tiny.mba\n🤝  my community: indyhall.org\n📈  my 10 year goal: 10k.city\n\n\nOn Thu, Jan 22, 2026 at 12:00 PM Matt Pocock <mattpocockvoice@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Thanks for the above.

        "body": "Okay got it!\n\nFirst, great news about the workshop sales selling out 🙌 that is great\nsignal.\n\nGiven this, and of course your own motivation being a huge piece of the\nsuccess, here's what we're thinking for the big picture year long plan at a\nvery high level:\n\n*Each quarter is punctuated by a cohort and we work backwards from that. *\n\nWithin each quarter, you'll have a combination of components:\n\n   - *A smaller product launch. *Think something on par with the half day\n   workshop or AI-SDK Crash Course)that provides both revenue AND\n   assets/insights that carry forward and compound\n   - *At least one new FREEBIE launch, aimed at the top of funnel. *This\n   would tie into your Twitter/Youtube activity and be designed to get people\n   from those platforms to the list\n   - *At least one cohort. *I say at least one, because this could *also* turn\n   into a rhythm where on month 1 of a quarter you re-run a past cohort, and\n   month 3 you launch a new one. This exact rhythm could vary, but the goal\n   would be to blend the leverage of cohorts that people missed the first time\n   AND introducing new things that you're excited about.\n\nIn the case of Q1 (now), since it's almost the end of Jan already and this\ncohort is effectively your small product launch in Feb, I don't think we\nwill be able to fit a re-run in but we can absolutely plan for it at the\ntop of Q2.\n\nWe'd map this out on a calendar to make sure it's clear and the overlapping\ntimelines make sense, but wanted to share this first for an initial gut\ncheck.\n\nHow's that land for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Alex\n\n📙  my book: tiny.mba\n🤝  my community: indyhall.org\n📈  my 10 year goal: 10k.city\n\n\nOn Thu, Jan 22, 2026 at 12:00 PM Matt Pocock <mattpocockvoice@gmail.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Thanks for the above.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly.

You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools.

You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works?

They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days.

The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory.

Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nteam@aihero.dev\nteam@aihero.dev\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Google Calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it.

Only  left.The Ralph  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Geoffrey Huntley figured out the pattern. Matt Pocock validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Ralph Wiggum from The Simpsons, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Reserve Your SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Hooking Up Ralph To Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed?

        "body": "Hey Matt!\n\n\nThe workshop plan sounds good to me. \n\n\nA couple things:\n\n\nWe sent our proposal to Joel and we suggest $199-249 for this half-day workshop, but based on your goals you've stated above, we think we should revise that to $99-129. Please don't take this the wrong way, we're not saying it doesn't have the value! \n\n\nThink of it as a \"doorbuster.\" Something to lure people in with a no brainer price.\n\n\nThis will help you bring in a wider audience, appeal to many more people than just the ones already super hype about Ralph. Instead of preaching to the crowd, as it were. Somebody who just heard about it will likely open their wallet for $99. Fewer will do it for $199. Very few will do it for $399. \n\n\nSince your workshop can support more people, since it won't be very interactive — more of a talk, really — you don't need to limit seats, and could use this to potentially get lots of people into the habit of buying from you. \n\n\nOnce somebody's bought from you once, they're very likely to buy from you again!\n\n\nThe other elements to the price are \"comparison to your other offerings' price\" and \"how easy is Ralph to sell?\" \n\n\nIf you price it at $400, that's almost as much as somebody would pay for your week-long cohort, with discounts.\n\n\nAnd Ralph is not a big, sweeping thing, general thing, compared to what you teach in those cohorts. Right now, it's very niche. And in our experience so far, selling niche \"branches\" off the AI tree is not working as well as more general whole project approaches. Makes sense, because the field is still new.\n\n\nThis doesn't close the door on offering a higher-tier Ralph offering later. \n\n\nYou don't have to add this to your library, even. It could be a one-off special event.\n\n\nSo, especially considering this is a quick launch you want to use to draw in the audience from your appearances, $99-129 is a price that makes an easy sell to the widest audience and will leave people feeling like they got a great value.\n\n\nLastly, let's not call it a cohort, which makes it sound like a multi-day course. It's a 1-day workshop. :) \n\n\nAmy\n\n—\nAmy Hoy\n\nstackingthebricks.com\n\n--- original message ---\nOn January 13, 2026 at 6:58 AM MST mattpocockvoice@gmail.com wrote:\n\n\nDefer to Joel, but probably $400-500?\n\n\n> On Tue, Jan 13, 2026 at 1:08 PM Alex Hillman <alex@indyhall.org> wrote:\n\n\n>> Looking at that vague shape, what's your gut feeling on a price point? \n\n\n\n>> We see a couple ways to go with this, curious what your expectations are to start! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>>> On Tue, Jan 13, 2026 at 7:01 AM Alex Hillman <alex@indyhall.org> wrote:\n\n\n>>>> In our case it's solo work that they bring back for peer and teacher feedback. \n\n\n\n>>>> Our full loop is:\n\n>>>> - 5 minute solo exercise BEFORE they learn the technique, sort of a set up to show them that they need to pay attention.

Now time has changed and I feel like I'm getting behind with all\nAI innovations.\nThere are a few areas that interest me about AI:\n\n   - Product development - how can AI models/agents/workflows enhance my\n   product, how can I make users life easier.\n   - Software development lifecycle - how can AI help me to write better\n   code and deliver better product features.\n\nI think, in more general terms, I'm interested in understanding how to\ndesign and build AI flows, be it agents or workflows. I'm also interested\nin learning how to assess different models to be able to choose one that\nsuits the use-case best.\n\nI hope it helps.\n\nCheers,\nAnton\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jan 19, 2026 at 11:01 PM Total TypeScript <team@totaltypescript.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey Anton Klimenko,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community\n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vulzzp746sguo9vw06flhvze4k55hnh77003/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v>\n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is pretty\n> new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?
