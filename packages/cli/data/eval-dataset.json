The only part\nI wish there was some more instruction was on the setup. Like how the\nfrontend communicates with the backend. If I was going to try to implement\nsome of these features in my project I'd like a clear understanding of the\ntypical setup. Specifically, it took some digging to find that `useChat`\ndefaults to calling `/api/chat`. I had assumed you had done some routing in\nthe setup of the project so my first investigation was misguided.\n\nIt's a nitpick at best, I love the course/content and all the thumbs up I\ngot along the way 👍\n\nThank you,\nDan\n\nOn Mon, Jan 19, 2026 at 3:35 PM AI Hero <team@aihero.dev> wrote:\n\n>\n>  ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿ ‌​‍‎‏﻿\n>\n> If you have any questions or feedback, please reply to this email and let\n> me know.\n>\n> Cheers,\n>\n> Matt Pocock\n> unsubscribe\n> <https://subscriptions.pstmrk.it/unsubscribe?m=1.DZoa_zVmUVkLCwiDURGXSg.FQGDd8ZlcBL83-CQbO6XdL6LTzWlLf_6ICYulIeg5z9lJDTm6OcJuufHPKvonVi_Z_DRgGbucUDecrEWV7b66HRHza--Wu2eBUVNUr-pNz5ZyJ0n1pEnjYd0FFT8PHYjkUU8mEyPQFXLdZ8aycQGHQi1WZFwQFuT97-Yfto6Ni_uvhRLZFqWkY_Vp-kG72rbCEssQTDfyZRRDrhFAhs3qUDQUYGedg7MNikugIddZoDRH5hKkwHgSbjYWfTChzkqZFEums3BJEurbdNAbkMihOMwdjbFrZCjUM9Uac5r1YXj1hneNC3y2tRC9UKWHTBaKr83yuCcoBh5_n_C5N_Z-G2PHZF9CSymSHsX08hrgHp7yCuaX195i8cG6_Yxo5Bo8FVwjW-Y-FEGHVVzk0CDeKSX-KM2iPdIW4NNB527eaHI5CQLmJmWHaTlMNvRqfAzN4kyzsBgpRqBsaNT_DAspLRkY5MAeJlfp1hQzskSXgU>\n> 12333 Sowden Rd, Ste.

Your breakdown of AI tools and how to\nuse them best is always spot on.\n\nI'm reaching out from Composio <https://composio.dev/> about a partnership\nopportunity around the Cowork launch.\n\nAs you know, Cowork is trending. We recently shipped *Open **Claude CoWork\n(*https://github.com/ComposioHQ/open-claude-cowork*)*, an open-source take\non Claude Code. Most existing implementations (including others in OSS) are\nessentially GUI or browser-based wrappers that automate tasks locally or\nrely on browser automation for SaaS apps — which gets slow and brittle.\n\nWhat makes Co-Work different is that it comes *natively integrated with\n800+ APIs* as composio manages the auth on backend. This means users can\nnot only automate desktop tasks, but actually complete real knowledge work\nacross tools like Linear, Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc. fast.\n\nWe’d love to collaborate on a dedicated video where you walk through\nCo-Work and, in the process, explore why deep, API-level integrations\nmatter for agentic workflows.\n\nThe project’s getting strong organic traction already — Julian Goldie and\nTom Doerr have both shared it recently — and momentum is picking up\nquickly. I have attached some example demos of its capabilities. Do you\nthink this will be a fit for your audience?\n\nWould love to do a dedicated video this week.\nBest,\nAudery Graham\nComposio <https://composio.dev/>\n",

      "text": "This is a module system issue, not a version problem. Your compiled JavaScript has `export` statements, but browsers need a module-aware script tag to understand them.\n\nIn your HTML file, change:\n```html\n<script src=\"example.js\"></script>\n```\n\nTo:\n```html\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"example.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe `type=\"module\"` tells the browser to treat the file as an ES module, which supports import/export syntax.\n\nIf that doesn't match what the lesson expects, the alternative is changing your TypeScript compiler settings to output a different module format (like CommonJS or a bundled file), but adding `type=\"module\"` to the script tag is the typical fix here.",

As a frontend/full-stack dev with ~9 years\nof professional experience in JS/TS/React/Node/Vercel/etc, I am always\nlooking for great sources to help me get better.\n\nYour work has really spoken to me on multiple levels\n\n   1. Your work around following and growing in this fast-paced era of AI\n   engineering - it's daunting to keep up with everything that is changing,\n   and not just use the ever-changing tools of the day, but *use them well*.\n   Looking for quality, tested, focused changes I can make to my day-to-day\n   workflow makes keeping up feel manageable, even exciting\n   2. Leveling up in my fundamentals - I was a bootcamp grad, I have no\n   formal CS training, and in my career in startups I've found that the focus\n   is almost always entirely on shipping and not on learning the fundamentals.\n   I often feel like I just sort of skipped past a lot of that, and now as I\n   look to become a contributor worthy of senior/staff level, missing those\n   foundations really matters. Typescript is an area where I know some\n   technical growth can pay major professional dividends.\n\nI'm really excited to dive more deeply into your work, as it seems like you\nstructure things in a very intentional way to have others learn.\n\nBest,\nAndrew\n\nOn Wed, Jan 7, 2026 at 10:01 PM Total TypeScript <team@totaltypescript.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey Andrew,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community\n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmul2v4o90u3urpod8vh5h2q34zllfnhdd66q/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v>\n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is pretty\n> new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?
