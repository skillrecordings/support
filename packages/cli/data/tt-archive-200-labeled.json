Your breakdown of AI tools and how to\nuse them best is always spot on.\n\nI'm reaching out from Composio <https://composio.dev/> about a partnership\nopportunity around the Cowork launch.\n\nAs you know, Cowork is trending. We recently shipped *Open **Claude CoWork\n(*https://github.com/ComposioHQ/open-claude-cowork*)*, an open-source take\non Customer Name. Most existing implementations (including others in OSS) are\nessentially GUI or browser-based wrappers that automate tasks locally or\nrely on browser automation for SaaS apps — which gets slow and brittle.\n\nWhat makes Co-Work different is that it comes *natively integrated with\n800+ APIs* as composio manages the auth on backend. This means users can\nnot only automate desktop tasks, but actually complete real knowledge work\nacross tools like Linear, Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc. fast.\n\nWe’d love to collaborate on a dedicated video where you walk through\nCo-Work and, in the process, explore why deep, API-level integrations\nmatter for agentic workflows.\n\nThe project’s getting strong organic traction already — Customer Name and\nCustomer Name have both shared it recently — and momentum is picking up\nquickly. I have attached some example demos of its capabilities. Do you\nthink this will be a fit for your audience?\n\nWould love to do a dedicated video this week.\nBest,\nCustomer Name\nComposio <https://composio.dev/>\n"

Leveling up in my fundamentals - I was a bootcamp grad, I have no\n   formal CS training, and in my career in startups I've found that the focus\n   is almost always entirely on shipping and not on learning the fundamentals.\n   I often feel like I just sort of skipped past a lot of that, and now as I\n   look to become a contributor worthy of senior/staff level, missing those\n   foundations really matters.

In other\nwords, if your loop picks up a task and fails to implement that task, does the\nnext iteration in the loop pick up the failed task and try again, or does it\npotentially pick another task? Perhaps another way to ask is: if you specify a\nmax-iterations of 10 but your PRD has 20 items, will your ralph loop stop after\nimplementing 10 items (assuming it implements each item successfully on its\nfirst attempt)?\n"

We\nthink DevTools aligns well with those themes.\n\nI’m reaching out from DevTools — we built a Go-based API client that lets\nyou turn real browser traffic (HAR files) into replayable API flows. It’s\nway faster than Postman and Bruno, and you can export everything as\nreadable YAML for version control and Git review.\n\nDevTools is open source, works as both a CLI and a desktop app, and has a\nvisual builder for flow trees and reusable checks. It’s perfect for\ndevelopers and QA teams looking to speed up API testing and automate flows\nin CI.\n\nWe’re running a paid promo for creators — happy to discuss rates for a\nsponsored feature or demo.\n\nIf you’re interested, let me know and I’ll send over more details!\n\nThanks,\nMustafa\n"
