It seems the checkout system doesn't allow me to combine the holiday code with the India Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) pricing. When I apply the code, it defaults to the global price, which brings the total to $198.\n\nGiven my current situation of being out of work for six months, $198 is still quite a high hurdle for me to clear right now.\n\nIs there any way to generate a specific code that applies a further discount to the India regional price, or perhaps a different way to process this so I can get closer to a manageable amount?\n\nThank you again for your patience and for trying to help me make this work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiva\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nOn Tuesday, 01/13/26 at 04:51 Haze Provinsal <team@totaltypescript.com> wrote:\n\n> Hey Siva,\n>\n> The greatest discount you can get Is the PPP discount from India.\n>\n> But I can still extend the holiday discount for you.

It seems the checkout system doesn't allow me to combine the holiday code with the India Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) pricing. When I apply the code, it defaults to the global price, which brings the total to $198.\n\nGiven my current situation of being out of work for six months, $198 is still quite a high hurdle for me to clear right now.\n\nIs there any way to generate a specific code that applies a further discount to the India regional price, or perhaps a different way to process this so I can get closer to a manageable amount?\n\nThank you again for your patience and for trying to help me make this work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiva\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nOn Tuesday, 01/13/26 at 04:51 Haze Provinsal <team@totaltypescript.com> wrote:\n\n> Hey Siva,\n>\n> The greatest discount you can get Is the PPP discount from India.\n>\n> But I can still extend the holiday discount for you.
