At the stroke of MIDNIGHT (pacific, check here for your timezone\n   (https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/d0udqwwxqmf0hor629kfmhzl7d544ilh00llw/x0hph3uexpxmqoc5/aHR0cHM6Ly9ldmVyeXRpbWV6b25lLmNvbS9zL2RmNTdhZTIz)\n   ), the price goes up to $795!\n\n   Don’t miss your chance to get the best price on the challenging,\n   exciting, guided step-by-step program that’ll take you from wherever you\n   are now to total mastery of TypeScript’s arcane powers.\n\n   You can become the TypeScript Wizard of your team —\n\n     * The one who knows TypeScript in & out, back to front, top to bottom\n     * Who can solve problems at the level where they occur (and before they\n     happen!)\n     * And the one who can help others do it, too\n     * Who can confidently contribute to open source (or release your own!)\n     * And who can blow people’s minds (including your own!) with “how did\n     you do that??”\n\n\n   —and you can have fun doing it. Skip the boring 30-minute lectures and\n   get right to learning by doing.\n\n   Total TypeScript scales to your skill level.\n\n   It’s divided into 5 workshops based on skill level, experience level, and\n   topic, so you can jump straight to the starting place that makes sense to\n   you, whether you’re new to the world of powerful JavaScript web\n   applications, or a senior engineer touching TypeScript for the first time\n   — or a beginner, intermediate, or even advanced user of TypeScript\n   already.\n\n\n  “The content itself was incredible. Videos are superb. Delivery, pacing,\n  tone, everything- wow. I feel like I have superpowers. I’ve already made\n  one library available!” - Jökull Sólberg\n\n\n\n  “You know those kung fu movies where the hero has a training montage\n  beating the shit out of a tree so he can get good & murder his enemy? That\n  ’s what Customer Name’s Total TypeScript is like. Except TS instead of Kung\n  Fu. Customer Name tickets instead of your enemy. Anyway it’s great.” - Adam\n  Rackis\n\n\n   Still trying to decide if Total TypeScript is right for you? Here are \n   some questions to ask yourself:\n\n     * Does it feel like you’re using TypeScript with gloves on — never\n     quite grasping it with the finesse you’d like?\n     * Like you’re working against TypeScript, instead of fully seizing its\n     promise of faster, cleaner code with fewer bugs and headaches?\n     * Do you find yourself wondering what new and obscure errors mean? \n     * Do you feel in total control with any, infer, satisfies, never,\n     unknown and other advanced tools?\n     * Have you mastered generics for creating code that’s flexible,\n     reusable, and DRY? How about transformations?\n     * Are you ready to become completely confident in your abilities in \n     2026 — not just to know what to do, and when, but to solve problems\n     that arise from AI assistants?\n     * And would you learn more, faster, and better (and have more fun) with\n     a code-first learning experience and an expert guide (yours truly)?\n\n\n   If you’ve answered “yes” to these questions, then Total TypeScript\n   Complete is a great choice!\n\n   You’ll get instant access to 400+ coding challenges in 5 comprehensive\n   workshops from beginner to extremely advanced when you enroll.\n\n   And remember: while I’ve laid out a 26-week path to take you from total\n   TS beginner to Wizard, you can start anywhere — at your own level of\n   experience — and you can go at your own pace. Your purchase includes\n   lifetime access to all 5 workshops.\n\n   Save $398 by signing up before midnight tonight!

Your\naudience’s interest in LLMs, RAG systems, and MLOps also aligns closely\nwith what we’re building at *Zilliz*\n<https://zilliz.com?utm_source=email&utm_medium=kol_pitch&utm_campaign=p> —\nthe team behind *Milvus* <https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus>, the world’s\nmost popular open-source vector database.\n\nWe’re currently exploring *paid collaborations* with leading creators to\nboost awareness of Milvus and Zilliz, and to help developers learn how to\nbuild smarter, more scalable AI search and retrieval systems. Our focus is\nmainly on YouTube videos — *hands-on explainers, tech deep dives, or\ncreative showcases* — but we're also open to LinkedIn or X if you prefer\nthose formats.\n\nSome content themes we’re especially excited about include:\n\n   - *Building intelligent AI systems* — showing how search, retrieval, or\n   memory make agents more capable\n   - *Scaling AI infrastructure* — exploring performance, latency, and cost\n   trade-offs as apps move from prototype to production\n   - *Bridging data and AI* — helping developers turn unstructured data\n   into powerful context for LLMs\n\nTo help you get a quick sense of what we’re working on, here’s our\nlatest *Creator\nBrief* with examples and technical resources:\n\n📄 Customer Name Brief\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/18UDda1rEUSFbzcbJUIagw7XK7XzTFXCTmsGcHU587dA/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nIf this sounds interesting, I’d love to explore a collaboration. When you\nreply, could you also share:\n\n   - *Your current availability* — any open slots in the next few weeks?\n   - *Your typical production timeline* — how long you usually need for\n   scripting → filming → publishing\n   - *Your preferred content angles* — any topics above that excite you, or\n   ideas you’d like to explore?\n   - *Your rates or media kit* — so we can align quickly\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you,\n\nBest,\n*Customer Name*\nCustomer Name Associate | Zilliz\n\n[image: Zilliz × Milvus]\n\n© 2025 Zilliz.

I have some backend TS experience, and some years working in Java at a large tech company.\n\n\n\nI purchased the Customer Name series when it was on sale in December, and I'm finally getting around to looking through it more closely. It feels quite a bit over my head currently, and I see one section on React that is not relevant to the work I'll be doing. I'm wondering, from your perspective, how relevant is the rest of the Customer Name series to a backend-only TS dev (API design/implementation, database connection, etc)?

It’s\nway faster than Postman and Bruno, and you can export everything as\nreadable YAML for version control and Git review.\n\nDevTools is open source, works as both a CLI and a desktop app, and has a\nvisual builder for flow trees and reusable checks. It’s perfect for\ndevelopers and QA teams looking to speed up API testing and automate flows\nin CI.\n\nWe’re running a paid promo for creators — happy to discuss rates for a\nsponsored feature or demo.\n\nIf you’re interested, let me know and I’ll send over more details!\n\nThanks,\nMustafa\n"

Thank you for\nputting that together; it is fantastic. QQ: When you specify the number of\niterations, does that apply to a single item in your PRD or all items? In other\nwords, if your loop picks up a task and fails to implement that task, does the\nnext iteration in the loop pick up the failed task and try again, or does it\npotentially pick another task? Perhaps another way to ask is: if you specify a\nmax-iterations of 10 but your PRD has 20 items, will your ralph loop stop after\nimplementing 10 items (assuming it implements each item successfully on its\nfirst attempt)?\n"

As a frontend/full-stack dev with ~9 years\nof professional experience in JS/TS/React/Node/Vercel/etc, I am always\nlooking for great sources to help me get better.\n\nYour work has really spoken to me on multiple levels\n\n   1. Your work around following and growing in this fast-paced era of AI\n   engineering - it's daunting to keep up with everything that is changing,\n   and not just use the ever-changing tools of the day, but *use them well*.\n   Looking for quality, tested, focused changes I can make to my day-to-day\n   workflow makes keeping up feel manageable, even exciting\n   2. Leveling up in my fundamentals - I was a bootcamp grad, I have no\n   formal CS training, and in my career in startups I've found that the focus\n   is almost always entirely on shipping and not on learning the fundamentals.\n   I often feel like I just sort of skipped past a lot of that, and now as I\n   look to become a contributor worthy of senior/staff level, missing those\n   foundations really matters. Typescript is an area where I know some\n   technical growth can pay major professional dividends.\n\nI'm really excited to dive more deeply into your work, as it seems like you\nstructure things in a very intentional way to have others learn.\n\nBest,\nAndrew\n\nCustomer Name, Jan 7, 2026 at 10:01 PM Total TypeScript <user@example.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Customer Name,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community\n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmul2v4o90u3urpod8vh5h2q34zllfnhdd66q/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v>\n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is pretty\n> new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?

Your breakdown of AI tools and how to\nuse them best is always spot on.\n\nI'm reaching out from Composio <https://composio.dev/> about a partnership\nopportunity around the Cowork launch.\n\nAs you know, Cowork is trending. We recently shipped *Open **Claude CoWork\n(*https://github.com/ComposioHQ/open-claude-cowork*)*, an open-source take\non Customer Name. Most existing implementations (including others in OSS) are\nessentially GUI or browser-based wrappers that automate tasks locally or\nrely on browser automation for SaaS apps — which gets slow and brittle.\n\nWhat makes Co-Work different is that it comes *natively integrated with\n800+ APIs* as composio manages the auth on backend. This means users can\nnot only automate desktop tasks, but actually complete real knowledge work\nacross tools like Linear, Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc. fast.\n\nWe’d love to collaborate on a dedicated video where you walk through\nCo-Work and, in the process, explore why deep, API-level integrations\nmatter for agentic workflows.\n\nThe project’s getting strong organic traction already — Customer Name and\nCustomer Name have both shared it recently — and momentum is picking up\nquickly. I have attached some example demos of its capabilities. Do you\nthink this will be a fit for your audience?\n\nWould love to do a dedicated video this week.\nBest,\nCustomer Name\nComposio <https://composio.dev/>\n"

We’ve previously collaborated with top creators on YouTube and TikTok and are open to new collaborations. \n\n\n\nFormat of cooperation: \n\n• Our main focus is an integration in one of your upcoming YouTube videos (30–90 seconds) \n\n• Other options are also possible: short mentions, full dedicated reviews, or integrations on Instagram or TikTok \n\n• A special promo code providing your audience with 1 month of free access \n\n• We’ll share all necessary materials and links beforehand to make preparation as simple as possible. If this collaboration appeals to you, we’ll send a media kit for further details. \n\n\n\nAgreement details: \n\n• This is a paid partnership — we welcome your pricing and can provide partial prepayment if that’s easier \n\n• Timing is open — we’ll fit your availability \n\n• Your creative freedom is important to us, so the integration will remain organic. \n\n\n\nPlease share your usual rates or media kit when convenient. After that, we’ll prepare the paperwork and campaign materials. \n\nIf you prefer, we can set up a quick Zoom call (10–15 minutes) to cover the details. \n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---- Customer Name, 09 Oct 2025 05:39:21 +0300 Customer Name <user@example.com> wrote ---\n\n\n\nHey mailto:user@example.com ,\n\n\n\nWe support any questions related to the course and platform functionality, but you can reach out to Matt directly on X/bluesky/discord for this kind of collaboration.\n\n\n\nhttps://x.com/mattpocockuk  \n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/mattpocock.com  \n\nhttps://www.mattpocock.com/  \n\n\n\nBest,\n\n\n—\n\nHaze\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Name 6, 2025 at 6:35 AM PDT mailto:user@example.com  wrote:\n\nGreetings\n\nMy name is Courtney, and I am an advertising manager.
