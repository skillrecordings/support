Completed: SecretsProvider Abstraction (Phase 1) — Issue #179
Files: none
Summary: Summary:
- Made `@1password/sdk` a lazy runtime import in `packages/cli/src/core/secrets.ts` to avoid hard module resolution during tests.

- Updated progress log entry in `packages/cli/PROGRESS.

Codex: I see overlapping changes in `packages/cli/build.ts`, `packages/cli/tests/e2e/`, `packages/cli/package.json`, and `packages/cli/src/index.ts`. How should I proceed?

1. Use existing changes as the baseline and continue.  
2. Start fresh and overwrite with a clean implementation.
