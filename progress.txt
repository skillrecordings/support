Completed: Scrub or remove PII from artifacts directory
Files: none
Summary: Removed PII‑bearing artifacts by deleting all `*.json`/`*.jsonl` under `artifacts/` (the folder is already gitignored), keeping the non‑JSON artifacts intact.

Details
- Deleted tracked artifacts: `artifacts/phase-0/metrics/v1/cooccurrence.json`, `artifacts/phase-0/metrics/v1/resolution.json`, `artifacts/phase-0/metrics/v1/temporal.json`
- Deleted untracked artifacts: all other `*.json`/`*.jsonl`
