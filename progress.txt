Completed: Group Inngest commands under inngest subcommand
Files: none
Summary: Summary:
Moved all Inngest CLI registrations under a single `registerInngestCommands` entry point and wired `events`, `runs`, `signal`, and `investigate` to a shared `inngest` command group without changing flags or behavior.
Updated `packages/cli/src/index.ts` to call the single registration and removed duplicate/implicit command lookups.

Files changed:
- `packages/cli/src/commands/inngest/event
