Only  left.Customer Name  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Customer Name figured out the pattern. Customer Name validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.Customer Name  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Customer Name figured out the pattern. Customer Name validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.Customer Name  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Customer Name figured out the pattern. Customer Name validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.Customer Name  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Customer Name figured out the pattern. Customer Name validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world.

The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Immediate answers to your specific problems.</p><hr><h2>What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)</h2><p>This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.</p><h3>Section 1: Customer Name</h3><p><strong>Your own bash loop, not vendor plugins</strong></p><p>Customer Name plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.</p><p>You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.</p><p>We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.</p><p><strong>What this unlocks:</strong> Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.</p><hr><h3>Section 2: Customer Name</h3><p><strong>How agents catch their own mistakes</strong></p><p>Here&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.</p><p><strong>For backend:</strong> We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.</p><p><strong>For frontend:</strong> We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.</p><p>The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.</p><p><strong>What this unlocks:</strong> Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.</p><hr><h3>Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Customer Name</h3><p><strong>From GitHub issues to executed PRs</strong></p><p>Wire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.</p><p>You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it.

It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Customer Name figured out the pattern. Customer Name validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours. Each module gives you something you can implement immediately.Section 1: Getting StartedYour own bash loop, not vendor pluginsThe Anthropic plugin doesn&#39;t get the best out of Ralph. You&#39;re going to run your own bash loop instead.You&#39;ll build a working loop on your machine that gives you complete ownership. Works with Customer Name, OpenCode, Codex, or any coding agent CLI you choose. Your infrastructure, your control, your pricing.We&#39;ll walk through the exact setup, debug it live if it breaks, and make sure you&#39;ve got a loop running before we move on.What this unlocks: Everything else. This is your foundation—once it&#39;s running, you own the infrastructure and the loop.Section 2: Feedback LoopsHow agents catch their own mistakesHere&#39;s the secret: Agents are only as clever as the tools they use to interface with the world. Without feedback, they&#39;re coding blind. With the right tools, they can feel their way to working code.For backend: We teach Ralph to do TDD. Red-Green-Refactor is the perfect feedback loop. Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Write a failing test (Red). Write code until it passes (Green). Clean up (Refactor). The test gives the agent eyes. But tests can lie—you&#39;ll learn how to structure PRDs so agents write tests you can actually trust.For frontend: We hook Ralph up to an MCP server that can query the actual UI. The agent can see what&#39;s on screen, check if buttons exist, verify layouts rendered correctly. It&#39;s not guessing—it&#39;s looking.The agent runs, gets feedback, tries again, self-corrects. That&#39;s the loop.What this unlocks: Autonomy. Now the agent doesn&#39;t just execute—it validates, catches mistakes, and self-corrects.Section 3: Customer Name Customer Name Your BacklogFrom GitHub issues to executed PRsWire an agent to your GitHub backlog so it executes tasks without you.You&#39;ll structure your backlog so agents can parse it. Turn issues into agent-executable tasks using the specific pattern that works. Handle agent state and failures gracefully. Review PRs from agents (what to look for, what to ignore, what breaks most often).This is where you&#39;ll start seeing actual PRs getting created from your real issues.What this unlocks: Scale. Now you&#39;re not running the loop manually—it&#39;s connected to your backlog.Section 4: Making PRD&#39;s Ralph LovesThe skill that makes or breaks agent executionMost people can&#39;t write PRDs that agents execute correctly. Too vague? Agent guesses wrong. Too detailed? Agent misinterprets specifics.Here&#39;s the framework you&#39;ll learn:The 3-Layer PRD Structure:Context layer: What the agent needs to understand about the systemTask layer: The specific change broken into atomic stepsValidation layer: How the agent knows it succeededPlus the interview technique: You&#39;ll learn how to get the agent to help you build better PRDs by asking it the right questions about your task.By the end, you&#39;ll have written PRDs that agents can actually execute—not theory, actual working examples.Common mistakes that make agents hallucinate or fail:Being too abstract about &quot;what should happen&quot;Not specifying the validation criteriaForgetting to mention dependencies between tasks&lt;/l\n\nOrganizer\nuser@example.com\nuser@example.com\n\nGuests\n(Guest list has been hidden at organizer's request)\n\n~~//~~\nInvitation from Customer Name: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/\n\nYou are receiving this email because you are subscribed to calendar notifications.

Only  left.Customer Name  technique runs AI agents in loops with structured PRDs and feedback mechanisms. It&#39;s real, it&#39;s working in production, and you&#39;ll build it today.Customer Name figured out the pattern. Customer Name validated it with people shipping code. The technique has a name—Ralph (yeah, like Customer Name from Customer Name, because of course it does)—and developers are using it right now to clear their GitHub backlogs while they sleep.You&#39;re going to learn exactly how to build it.Interactive, hands-on, real code running on YOUR backlog by 1 PM.Here&#39;s the thing about AI coding agents right nowYou&#39;ve tried them. Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, whatever.You ask for Feature A. You get half a solution. You manually fix it. You ask for Feature B. It breaks Feature A. You&#39;re back to debugging. The cycle never ends.You&#39;re still doing the engineer&#39;s job. The AI is just doing grunt work.But here&#39;s what&#39;s actually happening right now, today, in production:Developers are setting up agents that run in loops. They point them at GitHub backlogs. The agents execute tasks—real tasks, not toy examples—and create working PRs. Without constant human intervention. Without hallucinating broken code into existence.This isn&#39;t theory. This is happening.The question is: Are you going to keep manually prompting AI and hoping it works? Or are you going to learn the systematic technique that actually makes this autonomous?Customer Name SpotWhy this works now (and didn&#39;t before)Two things changed:1. The models got good enoughOpus 4.5 and GPT 5.2 can execute complex tasks if you structure them right. They&#39;re not perfect, but they&#39;re finally smart enough to work in loops with proper feedback.2. The technique maturedThis isn&#39;t about better prompting. It&#39;s about:Running agents in loops (not one-shot prompts)Structuring PRDs so agents understand the task breakdownBuilding feedback mechanisms (types, tests, browser validation) so agents catch their own mistakesLetting the loop run until the agent self-corrects instead of you fixing everything manuallyWhen you combine capable models with this systematic approach, you get something that actually looks like autonomous execution.Not magic. Not perfect. But real, usable leverage.How we&#39;ll learn this: together, live, step-by-stepYou&#39;ll be:Debugging real code on screen with Matt. When something breaks (and it will), we&#39;ll figure it out together. Live.Hooking up Ralph directly to your tools. You&#39;ll connect the loop to a GitHub backlog and see real PRs getting created.Asking your questions in real-time and getting answers immediately. Not a forum post you check in 3 days. Right there, right then.Working in groups. You&#39;ll be mob programming in groups of 2-3, bouncing ideas off each other and learning collaboratively.By 1 PM, you&#39;ll have a Ralph setup that works for YOU.A blog post can explain concepts. A video can show you a demo. But neither can debug YOUR specific setup when your bash loop fails, or answer &quot;what happens if I structure my PRD THIS way?&quot; immediately, or show you how other developers in the workshop are solving the same problems you&#39;re hitting.That&#39;s what you&#39;re paying for. Immediate answers to your specific problems.What you&#39;re going to learn (and build)This is a half-day workshop. Four hours.

It seems the checkout system doesn't allow me to combine the holiday code with the India Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) pricing. When I apply the code, it defaults to the global price, which brings the total to $198.\n\nGiven my current situation of being out of work for six months, $198 is still quite a high hurdle for me to clear right now.\n\nIs there any way to generate a specific code that applies a further discount to the India regional price, or perhaps a different way to process this so I can get closer to a manageable amount?\n\nThank you again for your patience and for trying to help me make this work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiva\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nOn Tuesday, 01/13/26 at 04:51 Haze Provinsal <user@example.com> wrote:\n\n> Hey Siva,\n>\n> The greatest discount you can get Is the PPP discount from India.\n>\n> But I can still extend the holiday discount for you.
