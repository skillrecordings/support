Your breakdown of AI tools and how to\nuse them best is always spot on.\n\nI'm reaching out from Composio <https://composio.dev/> about a partnership\nopportunity around the Cowork launch.\n\nAs you know, Cowork is trending. We recently shipped *Open **Claude CoWork\n(*https://github.com/ComposioHQ/open-claude-cowork*)*, an open-source take\non Claude Code. Most existing implementations (including others in OSS) are\nessentially GUI or browser-based wrappers that automate tasks locally or\nrely on browser automation for SaaS apps — which gets slow and brittle.\n\nWhat makes Co-Work different is that it comes *natively integrated with\n800+ APIs* as composio manages the auth on backend. This means users can\nnot only automate desktop tasks, but actually complete real knowledge work\nacross tools like Linear, Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc. fast.\n\nWe’d love to collaborate on a dedicated video where you walk through\nCo-Work and, in the process, explore why deep, API-level integrations\nmatter for agentic workflows.\n\nThe project’s getting strong organic traction already — Julian Goldie and\nTom Doerr have both shared it recently — and momentum is picking up\nquickly. I have attached some example demos of its capabilities. Do you\nthink this will be a fit for your audience?\n\nWould love to do a dedicated video this week.\nBest,\nAudery Graham\nComposio <https://composio.dev/>\n",

Lately, I've been trying to build a\nsystem that produces reliable work on demand using specially designed\nprompts, workflows, phase gates, and verifiable iteration loops. Since I'm\na hands-on learner, I've been building small, custom CLI tools with Effect\nthat I can compose together into reusable systems I use daily.\n\nI'm interested in learning more about: controllability, repeatability, and\ncompounding leverage. What I want to learn the most: how to use Effect to\nmake AI outputs trustworthy enough to integrate into serious engineering\nworkflows without constant babysitting.\n\nThanks,\nCustomer\n\nOn Mon, Jan 19, 2026 at 7:00 PM Total TypeScript <user@example.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey Customer,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community\n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/wvud6km87rt6u5knv92h7hnq2okxxs8h66ppm/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v>\n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is pretty\n> new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?

Leveling up in my fundamentals - I was a bootcamp grad, I have no\n   formal CS training, and in my career in startups I've found that the focus\n   is almost always entirely on shipping and not on learning the fundamentals.\n   I often feel like I just sort of skipped past a lot of that, and now as I\n   look to become a contributor worthy of senior/staff level, missing those\n   foundations really matters. Typescript is an area where I know some\n   technical growth can pay major professional dividends.\n\nI'm really excited to dive more deeply into your work, as it seems like you\nstructure things in a very intentional way to have others learn.\n\nBest,\nCustomer\n\nOn Wed, Jan 7, 2026 at 10:01 PM Total TypeScript <user@example.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey Customer,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community\n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmul2v4o90u3urpod8vh5h2q34zllfnhdd66q/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v>\n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is pretty\n> new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?
