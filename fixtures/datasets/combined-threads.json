It seems the checkout system doesn't allow me to combine the holiday code with the India Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) pricing. When I apply the code, it defaults to the global price, which brings the total to $198.\n\nGiven my current situation of being out of work for six months, $198 is still quite a high hurdle for me to clear right now.\n\nIs there any way to generate a specific code that applies a further discount to the India regional price, or perhaps a different way to process this so I can get closer to a manageable amount?\n\nThank you again for your patience and for trying to help me make this work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSiva\n\n-------- Original Message --------\nOn Tuesday, 01/13/26 at 04:51 Haze Provinsal <user@example.com> wrote:\n\n> Hey Siva,\n>\n> The greatest discount you can get Is the PPP discount from India.\n>\n> But I can still extend the holiday discount for you.

I have a few questions below so that I'm best prepared:\n\n> What you need to bring Technical requirements:\n>\n> - GitHub account with a repo you can work on\n\nDoes this repo need to be public, or can it be private work-related?\nBetter if my repo is full-stack, front-end, or back-end?\nAny other guidance on the repo (which programming language, webapp or mobile app, etc.) for the smoothest 4 hours? I have flexibility and am asking because I'll be creating the repo for the course.\n\n> - Any one of these AI coding CLIs installed and working:\n>\n> - Claude Code (Opus 4.5)\n> - OpenCode\n> - Copilot CLI\n> - Codex (GPT 5.2)\n\nDo you always stick with a specific agent while Ralphing? With my legacy pre-Ralph HITL Cursor AI ways, I would find even the smartest agents (Opus 4.5 and GPT 5.2) can struggle or hit a dead-end while the other smart agent can sometimes quickly solve, so at times I flip agents. Perhaps you never encountered this, or perhaps those clear PRDs of yours make the problem far less or non-existant.\n\nThanks!\nJon\n\nOn Thursday, January 22nd, 2026 at 11:09 AM, AI Hero <user@example.com> wrote:\n\n> You're In!

I have a few questions below so that I'm best prepared:\n\n> What you need to bring Technical requirements:\n>\n> - GitHub account with a repo you can work on\n\nDoes this repo need to be public, or can it be private work-related?\nBetter if my repo is full-stack, front-end, or back-end?\nAny other guidance on the repo (which programming language, webapp or mobile app, etc.) for the smoothest 4 hours? I have flexibility and am asking because I'll be creating the repo for the course.\n\n> - Any one of these AI coding CLIs installed and working:\n>\n> - Claude Code (Opus 4.5)\n> - OpenCode\n> - Copilot CLI\n> - Codex (GPT 5.2)\n\nDo you always stick with a specific agent while Ralphing?

While I’ve dabbled in PHP, HTML, and CSS for WordPress sites,\nI’ve never been a coder who builds from scratch—the barrier to entry for\ncreating production-ready software was always too high for someone with my\nschedule and family commitments.\n\nHowever, \"vibe coding\" with AI has changed everything. I started with\nLovable and have since moved on to using OpenCode (best) and Cursor\n(Antigravity is too flaky). I’ve been able to build extremely useful tools\nand websites for my small family business, and with the integration of\nGitHub and Vercel, the deployment process essentially takes care of itself.\n\nI’m interested in staying current with these self-work tools, but I'm also\nfascinated by what this means for the profession of software development.\nAs a product leader, my job spans business & vision vision, through\nideation, and to prod. We are seeing the removal of the primary bottleneck:\nthe cost and time associated with manual software production and\nmaintenance. For example, I recently used Codex 5.2 to add a complex 3D\nmodeling feature to an internal app for my wife’s business. I simply spoke\nthe requirements, and it handled the documentation, UI integration, and\ndatabase updates instantly.\n\nIn my career, that kind of update would have taken weeks or months of PRDs,\nrelease planning, and architectural compromises. I have also seen cycle\ntimes of years. Now, I can move from an idea to a preview environment in\nminutes. The speed of iteration—which Agile and SAFe could never solve—is\nfinally here because we are no longer limited by manual syntax entry by\ndevs.\n\nI followed you after seeing a recommendation from Theo at T3, specifically\nregarding your agents.md article. The idea that \"best practices\" are now\nprompts (or just conversations) rather than rigid frameworks is a massive\nshift. Even if the AI doesn't get it right the first time, the cost of\niterating five different versions is lower than the cost of a single\nplanning meeting.\n\nSoftware development is having its \"horse to engine\" moment. And what this\nmeans beyond just software development as well.\nBest regards,\n\nGraeme Port\n\nOn Sat, Jan 24, 2026 at 7:00 AM Matt Pocock (AI Hero) <user@example.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey Graeme,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community\n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u9g0lqpef9u234v9la2hdovqm66h7h33ggk/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v>\n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is pretty\n> new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?

While I’ve dabbled in PHP, HTML, and CSS for WordPress sites,\nI’ve never been a coder who builds from scratch—the barrier to entry for\ncreating production-ready software was always too high for someone with my\nschedule and family commitments.\n\nHowever, \"vibe coding\" with AI has changed everything. I started with\nLovable and have since moved on to using OpenCode (best) and Cursor\n(Antigravity is too flaky). I’ve been able to build extremely useful tools\nand websites for my small family business, and with the integration of\nGitHub and Vercel, the deployment process essentially takes care of itself.\n\nI’m interested in staying current with these self-work tools, but I'm also\nfascinated by what this means for the profession of software development.\nAs a product leader, my job spans business & vision vision, through\nideation, and to prod. We are seeing the removal of the primary bottleneck:\nthe cost and time associated with manual software production and\nmaintenance. For example, I recently used Codex 5.2 to add a complex 3D\nmodeling feature to an internal app for my wife’s business. I simply spoke\nthe requirements, and it handled the documentation, UI integration, and\ndatabase updates instantly.\n\nIn my career, that kind of update would have taken weeks or months of PRDs,\nrelease planning, and architectural compromises. I have also seen cycle\ntimes of years. Now, I can move from an idea to a preview environment in\nminutes. The speed of iteration—which Agile and SAFe could never solve—is\nfinally here because we are no longer limited by manual syntax entry by\ndevs.\n\nI followed you after seeing a recommendation from Theo at T3, specifically\nregarding your agents.md article. The idea that \"best practices\" are now\nprompts (or just conversations) rather than rigid frameworks is a massive\nshift. Even if the AI doesn't get it right the first time, the cost of\niterating five different versions is lower than the cost of a single\nplanning meeting.\n\nSoftware development is having its \"horse to engine\" moment. And what this\nmeans beyond just software development as well.\nBest regards,\n\nGraeme Port\n\nOn Sat, Jan 24, 2026 at 7:00 AM Matt Pocock (AI Hero) <user@example.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Hey Graeme,\n>\n> You might know me from the TypeScript community\n> <https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/r8u9g0lqpef9u234v9la2hdovqm66h7h33ggk/8ghqh3uog0v3vrik/aHR0cDovL3RvdGFsdHlwZXNjcmlwdC5jb20v>\n> which I've been a part of for a long time, but the world of AI is pretty\n> new to me.\n>\n> I'd love to get to know you better.\n>\n> What interests you about AI?
