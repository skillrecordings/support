We\nthink DevTools aligns well with those themes.\n\nI’m reaching out from DevTools — we built a Go-based API client that lets\nyou turn real browser traffic (HAR files) into replayable API flows. It’s\nway faster than Postman and Bruno, and you can export everything as\nreadable YAML for version control and Git review.\n\nDevTools is open source, works as both a CLI and a desktop app, and has a\nvisual builder for flow trees and reusable checks. It’s perfect for\ndevelopers and QA teams looking to speed up API testing and automate flows\nin CI.\n\nWe’re running a paid promo for creators — happy to discuss rates for a\nsponsored feature or demo.\n\nIf you’re interested, let me know and I’ll send over more details!\n\nThanks,\nMustafa\n"

See here for more details: https://x.com/jahooma/status/[PHONE]985185242.\n\n\nThe deliverables would entail:\n\n\n * 1 x Dedicated video or 1 x Integration in one of your YouTube videos \n * Published any day between January 26 - February 11\n * 1 tracking link in the description with a code giving your audience additional free credits\n   \n\nI'm currently scoping interest for this campaign, and would love to learn more about your rates if you are open to sharing that information. \n\n\nI would greatly appreciate if you could give me a reply by Tuesday (January 20). Thank you!\n\nBest,\nCustomer (discord: Customer.Customer.Customer.Customer)"
