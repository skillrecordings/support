It’s one of the simplest primitives available to developers, but we’ve been criminally underusing it in the AI coding world.\n\nInstead, we’re stuck in that frustrating cycle with AI coding assistants. You ask for Feature A, get half a solution, manually fix it, ask for Feature B, and it breaks Feature A. Rinse, repeat.\n\nBut here’s what’s actually happening right now in production: developers are setting up agents that run in loops with structured feedback mechanisms. They point them at GitHub backlogs. Real PRs get created. Without constant babysitting.\n\nIt’s called the Ralph Wiggum technique, and it’s not magic. It’s a simple, learnable pattern.\n\nI’m running a live workshop on February 11 at 9 AM PST<https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u8mez84guqh6x9mz3hvhqzd58rraoh99mmp/dphehmued0v29ncm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWloZXJvLmRldi9zL3JhbHBoLXdvcmtzaG9wLTAx> to teach you exactly how to build it. We’re capping at 40 developers because this is hands-on. You’ll be debugging YOUR code, not just watching me code.\n\nHere’s what you’ll leave with:\n\n  *   Your own bash loop running\n  *   Feedback mechanisms that let agents catch their own mistakes\n  *   Your GitHub backlog wired up to actually execute tasks\n  *   The PRD structure that makes agents do what you actually want\n\nBy 1 PM, you’ll have real PRs being generated from your actual issues.\n\nSign-ups are open now. Limited spots, and we’ve got a discount running through Feb 5th. Grab yours before they sell out.\n\nThe full details are here, including what actually breaks, why this works now (and didn’t before), and exactly what you need to bring.\n\nSecure Your Seat<https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u8mez84guqh6x9mz3hvhqzd58rraoh99mmp/dphehmued0v29ncm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWloZXJvLmRldi9zL3JhbHBoLXdvcmtzaG9wLTAx>\n\nSee you on February 11.\n\nUnsubscribe from AI Hero Emails<https://7751c435.click.convertkit-mail2.com/o8u8mez84guqh6x9mz3hvhqzd58rraoh99mmp/rehm5x5qf9umk04olri2/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudG90YWx0eXBlc2NyaXB0LmNvbS91bnN1YnNjcmliZWQ_c2VxdWVuY2U9YWlfaGVybw==>.
