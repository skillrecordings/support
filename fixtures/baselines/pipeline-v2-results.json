Is your build step actually running before you open the file in the browser? Make sure you've run the build command and are loading the bundled output, not the raw compiled JS.\n2. Check your tsconfig.json `module` setting - it should be something like `\"esnext\"` or `\"es2015\"`, not `\"commonjs\"`.\n3.
